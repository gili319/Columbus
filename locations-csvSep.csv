Guanahani,Guanahani$ Buenos Aires$ Argentina,-58.3802182,-34.6348804,They brought some women and boys with them$ and the fleet must now have had a large number of these willing or unwilling captives. This was the first organised transaction of slavery on the part of Columbus$ whose design was to send slaves regularly back to Spain in exchange for the cattle and supplies necessary for the colonies. There was not very much said now about religious conversion$ but only about exchanging the natives for cattle. The fine point of Christophers philosophy on this subject had been rubbed off; he had taken the first step a year ago on the beach at Guanahani$ and after that the road opened out broad before him. Slaves for cattle$ and cattle for the islands; and wealth from cattle and islands for Spain$ and payment from Spain for Columbus$ and money from Columbus for the redemption of the Holy Sepulchrethese were the links in the chain of hope that bound him to his pious idea. He had seen the same thing done by the Portuguese on the Guinea coast$ and it never occurred to him that there was anything the matter with it. On the contrary$ at this time his idea was only to take slaves from among the Caribs and man-eating islanders as a punishment for their misdeeds; but this$ like his other fine ideas$ soon had to give way before the tide of greed and conquest.
Ethiopia,Ethiopia,40.489673,9.145000000000001,There was a state reception$ with Admiral Azumbaga walking in front in scarlet and brocade$ followed by his captains$ Columbus among them$ dressed in gorgeous tunics and cloaks with golden collars and$ well hidden beneath their finery$ good serviceable cuirasses. The banner of Portugal was ceremoniously unfurled and dis played from the top of a tall tree. An altar was erected and consecrated by the chaplain to the expedition$ and a mass was sung for the repose of the soul of Prince Henry. The Portugal contingent were then met by Caramansa$ the king of the country$ who came$ surrounded by a great guard of blacks armed with assegais$ their bodies scantily decorated with monkey fur and palm leaves. The black monarch must have presented a handsome appearance$ for his arms and legs were decked with gold bracelets and rings$ he had a kind of dog-collar fitted with bells round his neck$ and some pieces of gold were daintily twisted into his beard. With these aids to diplomacy$ and doubtless also with the help of a dram or two of spirits or of the wine of Oporto$ the treaty was soon concluded$ and a very shrewd stroke of business accomplished for the King of Portugal; for it gave him the sole right of exchanging gaudy rubbish from Portugal for the precious gold of Ethiopia. When the contents of the two freight-ships had been unloaded they were beached and broken up by the orders of King John$ who wished it to be thought that they had been destroyed in the whirlpools of that dangerous sea$ and that the navigation of those rough waters was only safe for the caravels of the Navy. The fort was built in twenty days$ and the expedition returned$ laden with gold and ivory; Admiral Azumbaga remained behind in command of the garrison.
Ancona,Ancona $ Italy,13.518915,43.6158299,A great quantity of birds that began to fly about the ship made him think that they were near land$ but they turned out to be the harbingers of a storm. On Tuesday$ February 12th$ the sea and wind began to rise$ and it continued to blow harder throughout that night and the next day. The wind being aft he went under bare poles most of the night$ and when day came hoisted a little sail; but the sea was terrible$ and if he had not been so sure of the staunch little Nina he would have felt himself in danger of being lost. The next day the sea$ instead of going down$ increased in roughness; there was a heavy cross sea which kept breaking right over the ship$ and it became necessary to make a little sail in order to run before the wind$ and to prevent the vessel falling back into the trough of the seas. All through Thursday he ran thus under the half hoisted staysail$ and he could see the Pinta running also before the wind$ although since she presented more surface$ and was able to carry a little more sail than the Nina$ she was soon lost to sight. The Admiral showed lights through the night$ and this time there was no lack of response from Martin Alonso; and for some part of that dark and stormy night these two humanly freighted scraps of wood and cordage staggered through the gale showing lights to each other; until at last the light from the Pinta disappeared. When morning came she was no longer to be seen; and the wind and the sea had if anything increased. The Nina was now in the greatest danger. Any one wave of the heavy cross sea$ if it had broken fairly across her$ would have sunk her; and she went swinging and staggering down into the great valleys and up into the hills$ the steersmans heart in his mouth$ and the whole crew in an extremity of fear. Columbus$ who generally relied upon his seamanship$ here invoked external aid$ and began to offer bargains to the Almighty. He ordered that lots should be cast$ and that he upon whom the lot fell should make a vow to go on pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Guadaloupe carrying a white candle of five pounds weight. Same dried peas were brought$ one for every member of the crew$ and on one of them a cross was marked with a knife; the peas were well shaken and were put into a cap. The first to draw was the Admiral; he drew the marked pea$ and he made the vow. Lots were again drawn$ this time for a greater pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Loretto in Ancona; and the lot fell on a seaman named Pedro de Villa$the expenses of whose pilgrimage Columbus promised to pay. Again lots were drawn for a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Clara of Moguer$ the pilgrim to watch and pray for one night there; and again the lot fell on Columbus. In addition to these$ every one$ since they took themselves for lost$ made some special and private vow or bargain with God; and finally they all made a vow together that at the first land they reached they would go in procession in their shirts to pray at an altar of Our Lady.
Republic,Oklahoma City $ United States,-97.5341023,35.5324359, By far the most important element in the navigation of Columbus$ in so far as estimating his position was concerned$ was what is known as dead-reckoning that is to say$ the computation of the distance travelled by the ship through the water. At present this distance is measured by a patent log$ which in its commonest form is a propeller-shaped instrument trailed through the water at the end of a long wire or cord the inboard end of which is attached to a registering clock. On being dragged through the water the propeller spins round and the twisting action is communicated by the cord to the clock-work machinery which counts the miles. In the case of powerful steamers and in ordinary weather dead-reckoning is very accurately calculated by the number of revolutions of the propellers recorded in the engine-room; and a device not unlike this was known to the Romans in the time of the Republic. They attached small wheels about four feet in diameter to the sides of their ships; the passage of the water turned the wheels$ and a very simple gearing was arranged which threw a pebble into a tallypot at each revolution. This device$ however$ seems to have been abandoned or forgotten in Columbuss day$ when there was no more exact method of estimating dead-reckoning than the primitive one of spitting over the side in calm weather$ or at other times throwing some object into the water and estimating the rate of progress by its speed in passing the ships side. The hour-glass$ which was used to get the multiple for long distances$ was of course the only portable time measurer available for Columbus. These$ with a rough knowledge of astronomy$ and the taking of the altitude of the polar star$ were the only known means for ascertaining the position of his ship at sea.
Hill,Hill County$ TX$ USA,-97.179026,32.0621768,There are no paths or footprints left in the sea$ and the water furrowed on that morning more than four hundred years ago by the keels of Columbuss little fleet is as smooth and trackless as it was before they clove it. Yet if you approach Guanahani from the east during the hours of darkness you also will see a light that waxes and wanes on the horizon. What the light was that Columbus saw is not certain; it was probably the light from a torch held by some native woman from the door of her hut; but the light that you will see is from the lighthouse on Dixon Hill$ where a tower of coral holds a lamp one hundred and sixty feet above the sea at the north-east point of the island. It was erected in no sentimental spirit$ but for very practical purposes$ and at a date when Watlings Island had not been identified with the Guanahani of Columbuss landfall; and yet of all the monuments that have been raised to him I can think of nothing more appropriate than this lonely tower that stands by day amid the bright sunshine in the track of the trade wind$ and by night throws its powerful double flash every half-minute across the dark lonely sea. For it was by a light$ although not of mans kindling$ that Columbus was guided upon his lonely voyage and through his many difficulties; amid all his trials and disappointments$ dimly as it must have burned sometimes$ it never quite went out. Darkness was the name of the sea across which he took his way; darkness$ from his religious point of view$ was the state of the lands to which he journeyed; and$ whatever its subsequent worth may have been$ it was a burning fragment from the living torch of the Christian religion that he carried across the world with him$ and by which he sought to kindle the fire of faith in the lands of his discovery. So that there is a profound symbolism in those raying beams that now$ night after night$ month by month$ and year after year$ shine out across the sea from Watlings Island in the direction of the Old World.
Saint,Saint Louis $ United States,-90.23382319999999,38.6354598,Once more he exhibited his easy mastery of the art of navigation and his extraordinary gift for estimating dead-reckoning. After having been out of sight of land for eight weeks$ and while some of the sailors thought they might be in the Bay of Biscay$ and others that they were in the English Channel$ the Admiral suddenly announced that they were close to Cape Saint Vincent.
Ganges,Ganges,83.0319706,27.4036401,Still Columbus went on in pursuit of his geographical chimera; even gold had no power to detain him from the earnest search for this imaginary strait. Here and there along the coast he saw increasing signs of civilisationonce a wall built of mud and stone$ which made him think of Cathay again. He now got it into his head that the region he was in was ten days journey from the Ganges$ and that it was surrounded by water; which if it means anything means that he thought he was on a large island ten days sail to the eastward of the coast of India. Altogether at sea as to the facts$ poor Admiral$ but with heart and purpose steadfast and right enough.
Gate,Mohenjo-daro $ Pakistan,68.131907,27.3294326,Owing$ no doubt$ to the difficulties that this un fortunate purchase plunged him into$ Domenico was obliged to mortgage his house at St. Andrews Gate in the year 1477; and in 1489 he finally gave it up to Jacob Baverelus$ the cheese-monger$ his son-in-law. Susanna$ who had been the witness of his melancholy transactions for so many years$ and possibly the mainstay of that declining household$ died in 1494; but not$ we may hope$ before she had heard of the fame of her son Christopher. Domenico$ in receipt of a pension from the famous Admiral of the Ocean$ and no doubt talking with a deal of pride and inaccuracy about the discovery of the New World$ lived on until 1498; when he died also$ and vanished out of this world. He had fulfilled a noble destiny in being the father of Christopher Columbus.
Anne,Spruce $ United States,-83.55847949999999,44.7563515,The low coast of Jamaica$ hazy and blue at first$ but afterwards warming into a golden belt crowned by the paler and deeper greens of the foliage$ was sighted first by Columbus on Sunday$ May 4th; and he anchored the next day in the beautiful harbour of Saint Anne$ to which he gave the name of Santa Gloria. To the island itself he gave the name of Santiago$ which however has never displaced its native name of Jamaica. The dim blue mountains and clumps of lofty trees about the bay were wonderful even to Columbus$ whose eyes must by this time have been growing accustomed to the beauty of the West Indies$ and he lost his heart to Jamaica from the first moment that his eyes rested on its green and golden shores. Perhaps he was by this time a little out of conceit with Hayti; but be that as it may he retracted all the superlatives he had ever used for the other lands of his discovery$ and bestowed them in his heart upon Jamaica.
Isle,Isle $ United States,-93.4707923,46.138011,After sailing west two thousand leagues Cabot found land in the neighbourhood of Cape Breton$ and was thus in all probability the first discoverer$ since the Icelanders$ of the mainland of the New World. He turned northward$ sailed through the strait of Belle Isle$ and came home again$ having accomplished his task in three months. Cabot$ like Columbus$ believed he had seen the territory of the Great Khan$ of whom he told the interested population of Bristol some strange things. He further told them of the probable riches of this new land if it were followed in a southerly direction; told them some lies also$ it appears$ since he said that the waters there were so dense with fish that his vessels could hardly move in them. He received a gratuity of L10 and a pension$ and made a great sensation in Bristol by walking about the city dressed in fine silk garments. He took other voyages also with his son Sebastian$ who followed with him the rapid widening stream of discovery and became Pilot Major of Spain$ and President of the Congress appointed in 1524 to settle the conflicting pretensions of various discoverers; but so far as our narrative is concerned$ having sailed across from Bristol and discovered the mainland of the New World some years before Columbus discovered it$ John Cabot sails into oblivion.
Santiago,Santiago $ Chile,-70.6692655,-33.4488897,The four ships that made up the Admirals fleet on his fourth and last voyage were all small caravels$ the largest only of seventy tons and the smallest only of fifty. Columbus chose for his flagship the Capitana$ seventy tons$ appointing Diego Tristan to be his captain. The next best ship was the Santiago de Palos under the command of Francisco Porras; Porras and his brother Diego having been more or less foisted on to Columbus by Morales$ the Royal Treasurer$ who wished to find berths for these two brothers-in-law of his. We shall hear more of the Porras brothers. The third ship was the Gallega$ sixty tons$ a very bad sailer indeed$ and on that account entrusted to Bartholomew Columbus$ whose skill in navigation$ it was hoped$ might make up for her bad sailing qualities. Bartholomew had$ to tell the truth$ had quite enough of the New World$ but he was too loyal to Christopher to let him go alone$ knowing as he did his precarious state of health and his tendency to despondency. The captain of the Gallega was Pedro de Terreros$ who had sailed with the Admiral as steward on all his other voyages and was now promoted to a command. The fourth ship was called the Vizcaina$ fifty tons$ and was commanded by Bartolome Fieschi$ a friend of Columbuss from Genoa$ and a very sound$ honourable man. There were altogether 143 souls on board the four caravels.
Genoa,Genoa $ Italy,8.946256,44.4056499,If we examine his life in detail we find this alternating principle of conduct revealed throughout it. He was by nature clever$ kind-hearted$ rather large-souled$ affectionate$ and not very honest; all the acts prompted by his nature bear the stamp of these qualities. To them his early years had probably added little except piety$ sharp practice$ and that uncomfortable sense$ often bred amid narrow and poor surroundings$ that one must keep a sharp look-out for oneself if one is to get a share of the worlds good things. Something in his blood$ moreover$ craved for dignity and the splendour of high-sounding titles; craved for power also$ and the fulfilment of an arrogant pride. All these things were in his Ligurian blood$ and he breathed them in with the very air of Genoa. His mind was of the receptive rather than of the constructive kind$ and it was probably through those long years spent between sea voyages and brief sojourns with his family in Genoa or Savona that he conceived that vague Idea which$ as I have tried to show$ formed the impulse of his life during its brief initiative period. Having once received this Idea of discovery and like all other great ideas$ it was in the air at the time and was bound to take shape in some human brainhe had all his native and personal qualities to bring to its support. The patience to await its course he had learned from his humble and subordinate life. The ambition to work for great rewards was in his blood and race; and to belief in himself$ his curious vein of mystical piety was able to add the support of a ready belief in divine selection. This very time of waiting and endurance of disappointments also helped to cultivate in his character two separate qualitiesan endurance or ability to withstand infinite hardship and disappointment; and also a greedy pride that promised itself great rewards for whatever should be endured.
Azores,Azores$ Portugal,-25.6755944,37.7412488,Thus easy it is for a Pope to draw lines from pole to pole$ and across the deep of the sea. Yet the poles sleep still in their icy virginal sanctity$ and the blue waves through which that papal line passes shift and shimmer and roll in their free salt loneliness$ unaffected by his demarcation; the heathen also$ it appears$ since that distant day$ have had something to say to their disposition. If he had slept upon it another night$ poor Pope$ it might have occurred to him that west and east might meet on a meridian situated elsewhere on the globe than one hundred miles west of the Azores; and that the Portuguese$ who for the moment had nothing heathen except Africa left to them$ might according to his demarcation strike a still richer vein of heathendom than that granted to Spain. But the holy Pontiff$ bull neck$ low forehead$ impudent prominent nose$ and sensual lips notwithstanding$ is exhausted by his cosmographical efforts$ and he lets it rest at that. Later$ when Spain discovers that her privileges have been abated$ he will have to issue another Bull; but not to-day. Sufficient unto the day are the Bulls thereof. For the moment King proposes and Pope disposes; but the matter lies ultimately in the hands of the two eternal protagonists$ man and God.
Compline,Napa $ United States,-122.2883114,38.29862780000001,There were showers of rain sometimes$ but the moisture in that baking atmosphere only added to its stifling and enervating effects. All the while$ however$ the great slow current of the Atlantic was moving westward$ and there came a day when a heavenly breeze$ stirred in the torrid air and the musical talk of ripples began to rise again from the weedy stems of the ships. They sailed due west$ always into a cooler and fresher atmosphere; but still no land was sighted$ although pelicans and smaller birds were continually seen passing from south-west to north-east. As provisions were beginning to run low$ Columbus decided on the 31st July to alter his course to north-by-east$ in the hope of reaching the island of Dominica. But at mid-day his servant Alonso Perez$ happening to go to the masthead$ cried out that there was land in sight; and sure enough to the westward there rose three peaks of land united at the base. Here was the kind of coincidence which staggers even the unbeliever. Columbus had promised to dedicate the first land he saw to the Trinity; and here was the land$ miraculously provided when he needed it most$ three peaks in one peak$ in due conformity with the requirements of the blessed Saint Athanasius. The Admiral was deeply affected; the God of his belief was indeed a good friend to him; and he wrote down his pious conviction that the event was a miracle$ and summoned all hands to sing the Salve Regina$ with other hymns in praise of God and the Virgin Mary. The island was duly christened La Trinidad. By the hour of Compline (9 oclock in the evening) they had come up with the south coast of the island$ but it was the next day before the Admiral found a harbour where he could take in water. No natives were to be seen$ although there were footprints on the shore and other signs of human habitation.
Cardinal-Arch,Irvine $ United States,-117.7219155,33.6990751,It is to this period of splendour that the story of the egg$ which is to some people the only familiar incident in Columbian biography$ is attributed. The story is that at a banquet given by the Cardinal-Arch bishop the conversation ran$ as it always did in those days when he was present$ on the subject of the Admirals discoveries; and that one of the guests remarked that it was all very well for Columbus to have done what he did$ but that in a country like Spain$ where there were so many men learned in science and cosmography$ and many able mariners besides$ some one else would certainly have been found who would have done the same thing. Whereupon Columbus$ calling for an egg$ laid a wager that none of the company but him self could make it stand on its end without support. The egg was brought and passed round$ and every one tried to make it stand on end$ but without success. When it came to Columbus he cracked the shell at one end$ making a flat surface on which the egg stood upright; thus demonstrating that a thing might be wonderful$ not because it was difficult or impossible$ but merely because no one had ever thought of doing it before. A sufficiently inane story$ and by no means certainly true; but there is enough character in this little feat$ ponderous$ deliberate$ pompous$ ostentatious$ and at bottom a trick and deceitful quibble$ to make it accord with the grandiloquent public manner of Columbus$ and to make it easily believable of one who chose to show himself in his speech and writings so much more meanly and pretentiously than he showed himself in the true acts and business of his life.
Jutland,Egtved $ Denmark,9.201050000000002,55.62954999999999,This stream of life has grown in force and volume with the passage of ages. It has always set from shore to sea in countless currents of adventure and speculation; but it has set most strongly from East to West. On its broad bosom the seeds of life and knowledge have been carried throughout the world. It brought the people of Tyre and Carthage to the coasts and oceans of distant worlds; it carried the English from Jutland across cold and stormy waters to the islands of their conquest; it carried the Romans across half the world; it bore the civilisation of the far East to new life and virgin western soils; it carried the new West to the old East$ and is in our day bringing back again the new East to the old West. Religions$ arts$ tradings$ philosophies$ vices and laws have been borne$ a strange flotsam$ upon its unchanging flood. It has had its springs and neaps$ its trembling high-water marks$ its hour of affluence$ when the world has been flooded with golden humanity; its ebb and effluence also$ when it has seemed to shrink and desert the kingdoms set upon its shores. The fifteenth century in Western Europe found it at a pause in its movements: it had brought the trade and the learning of the East to the verge of the Old World$ filling the harbours of the Mediterranean with ships and the monasteries of Italy and Spain with wisdom; and in the subsequent and punctual decadence that followed this flood$ there gathered in the returning tide a greater energy and volume which was to carry the Old World bodily across the ocean. And yet$ for all their wisdom and power$ the Spanish and Portuguese were still in the attitude of our primitive man$ standing on the sea-shore and looking out in wonder across the sea.
Flores,Flores Department$ Uruguay,-56.8984566,-33.5169429,And so he went on for several days$ with the wind veering always south and south-west$ and pointing pretty steadily to the north-east. On February 4th he changed his course$ and went as near due east as he could. They now began to find themselves in considerable doubt as to their position. The Admiral said he was seventy-five leagues to the south of Flores; Vincenti Pinzon and the pilots thought that they had passed the Azores and were in the neighbourhood of Madeira. In other words$ there was a difference of 600 miles between their estimates$ and the Admiral remarks that the grace of God permitting$ as soon as land is seen$ it will be known who has calculated the surest.
Western,Kalamazoo $ United States,-85.6102507,42.2837336,The flood of the life-stream began to set again$ and little by little to rise and inundate Western Europe$ floating off the galleys and caravels of King Alphonso of Portugal$ and sending them to feel their way along the coasts of Africa; a little later drawing the mind of Prince Henry the Navigator to devote his life to the conquest and possession of the unknown. In his great castle on the promontory of Sagres$ with the voice of the Atlantic thundering in his ears$ and its mists and sprays bounding his vision$ he felt the full force of the stream$ and stretched his arms to the mysterious West. But the inner light was not yet so brightly kindled that he dared to follow his heart; his ships went south and south again$ to brave on each voyage the dangers and terrors that lay along the unknown African coast$ until at length his captains saw the Cape of Good Hope. South and West and East were in those days confusing terms; for it was the East that men were thinking of when they set their faces to the setting sun$ and it was a new road to the East that they sought when they felt their way southward along the edge of the world. But the rising tide of discovery was working in that moment$ engaging the brains of innumerable sages$ stirring the wonder of innumerable mariners; reaching also$ little by little$ to quarters less immediately concerned with the business of discovery. Ships carried the strange tidings of new coasts and new islands from port to port throughout the Mediterranean; Venetians on the lagoons$ Ligurians on the busy trading wharves of Genoa$ were discussing the great subject; and as the tide rose and spread$ it floated one ship of life after another that was destined for the great business of adventure. Some it inspired to dream and speculate$ and to do no more than that; many a heart also to brave efforts and determinations that were doomed to come to nothing and to end only in failure. And among others who felt the force and was swayed and lifted by the prevailing influence$ there lived$ some four and a half centuries ago$ a little boy playing about the wharves of Genoa$ well known to his companions as Christoforo$ son of Domenico the wool-weaver$ who lived in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello.
Valladolid,Valladolid $ Spain,-4.724532099999999,41.652251, He was in his fifty-sixth year$ already an old man in body and mind; and his death went entirely unmarked except by his immediate circle of friends. Even Peter Martyr$ who was in Valladolid just before and just after it$ and who was writing a series of letters to various correspondents giving all the news of his day$ never thought it worth while to mention that Christopher Columbus was dead. His life flickered out in the completest obscurity. It is not even known where he was first buried; but probably it was in the Franciscan convent at Valladolid. This$ however$ was only a temporary resting-place; and a few years later his body was formally interred in the choir of the monastery of Las Cuevas at Seville$ there to lie for thirty years surrounded by continual chauntings. After that it was translated to the cathedral in San Domingo; rested there for 250 years$ and then$ on the cession of that part of the island to France$ the body was removed to Cuba. But the Admiral was by this time nothing but a box of bones and dust$ as also were brother Bartholomew and son Diego$ and Diegos son$ all collected together in that place. There were various examinations of the bone-boxes; one$ supposed to be the Admirals$ was taken to Cuba and solemnly buried there; and lately$ after the conquest of the island in the Spanish-American War$ this box of bones was elaborately conveyed to Seville$ where it now rests.
Moa,Bloomington $ United States,-93.2422148,44.8548651,The Pinta was out of sight the next morning$ and the little Nina was all that the Admiral had to rely upon for convoy. They were now near the east end of the north coast of Cuba$ and they stood in to a harbour which the Admiral called Santa Catalina$ and which is now called Cayo de Moa. As the importance of the Nina to the expedition had been greatly increased by the defection of the Pinta$ Columbus went on board and examined her. He found that some of her spars were in danger of giving way; and as there was a forest of pine trees rising from the shore he was able to procure a new mizzen mast and latine yard in case it should be necessary to replace those of the Nina. The next morning he weighed anchor at sunrise and continued east along the coast. He had now arrived at the extreme end of Cuba$ and was puzzled as to what course he should take. Believing Cuba$ as he did$ to be the mainland of Cathay$ he would have liked to follow the coast in its trend to the south-west$ in the hope of coming upon the rich city of Quinsay; but on the other hand there was looming to the south-west some land which the natives with him assured him was Bohio$ the place where all the gold was. He therefore held on his course; but when the Indians found that he was really going to these islands they became very much alarmed$ and made signs that the people would eat them if they went there; and$ in order further to dissuade the Admiral$ they added that the people there had only one eye$ and the faces$ of dogs. As it did not suit Columbus to believe them he said that they were lying$ and that he felt that the island must belong to the domain of the Great Khan. He therefore continued his course$ seeing many beautiful and enchanting bays opening before him$ and longing to go into them$ but heroically stifling his curiosity$ because he was detained more than he desired by the pleasure and delight he felt in seeing and gazing on the beauty and freshness of those countries wherever he entered$ and because he did not wish to be delayed in prosecuting what he was engaged upon; and for these reasons he remained that night beating about and standing off and on until day. He could not trust himself$ that is to say$ to anchor in these beautiful harbours$ for he knew he would be tempted to go ashore and waste valuable time exploring the woods; and so he remained instead$ beating about in the open sea.
Prione,Ahmedabad $ India,72.54677079999999,23.0202841,If Christopher wanted to go down to the sea he would have to pass under the Gate of St. Andrew$ with the old prison$ now pulled down to make room for the modern buildings$ on his right$ and go down the Salita del Prione$ which is a continuation of the Vico Dritto di Ponticello. It slopes downwards from the Gate as the first street sloped upwards to it; and it contains the same assortment of shops and of houses$ the same mixture of handicrafts and industries$ as were seen in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello. Presently he would come to the Piazza dell Erbe$ where there is no grass$ but only a pleasant circle of little houses and shops$ with already a smack of the sea in them$ chiefly suggested by the shops of instrument-makers$ where to-day there are compasses and sextants and chronometers. Out of the Piazza you come down the Via di San Donato and into the Piazza of that name$ where for over nine centuries the church of San Donato has faced the sun and the weather. From there Christophers young feet would follow the winding Via di San Bernato$ a street also inhabited by craftsmen and workers in wood and metal; and at the last turn of it$ a gash of blue between the two cliffwalls of houses$ you see the Mediterranean.

He touched at Marigalante and at Guadaloupe$ where his people had an engagement with the natives$ taking several prisoners$ but releasing them all again with the exception of one woman$ a handsome creature who had fallen in love with Caonabo and refused to go. But for Caonabo the joys of life and love were at an end; his heart and spirit were broken. He was not destined to be paraded as a captive through the streets of Spain$ and it was somewhere in the deep Atlantic that he paid the last tribute to the power that had captured and broken him. He died on the voyage$ which was longer and much more full of hardships than usual. For some reason or other Columbus did not take the northerly route going home$ but sailed east from Gaudaloupe$ encountering the easterly trade winds$ which delayed him so much that the voyage occupied three months instead of six weeks.

Gradually the sea went down; the current which had opposed them here aided them$ and they were able to recover a little from the terrible strain of the last six weeks. The cape was called by Columbus Gracios de Dios; and on the 16th of September they landed at the entrance to a river to take in water. The boat which was sent ashore$ however$ capsized on the sandy bar of the entrance$ two men being drowned$ and the river was given the name of Rio de Desastre.

coast,Chicago $ United States,-87.61840649999999,41.8873607,And Ojeda was not the only person in Spain who was enticed by Columbuss glowing descriptions to go and look for the pearls of Paria. There was in fact quite a reunion of old friends of his and ours in the western ocean$ though they went thither in a spirit far different from that of ancient friendship. Pedro Alonso Nino$ who had also been on the Paria coast with Columbus$ who had come home with the returning ships$ and whose patience (for he was an exceedingly practical man) had perhaps been tried by the strange doings of the Admiral in the Gulf of Paria$ decided that he as well as any one else might go and find some pearls. Nino is a poor man$ having worked hard in all his voyagings backwards and forwards across the Atlantic; but he has a friend with money$ one Luis Guerra$ who provides him with the funds necessary for fitting out a small caravel about the size of his old ship the Nifta. Guerra$ who has the money$ also has a brother Christoval; and his conditions are that Christoval shall be given the command of the caravel. Practical Niflo does not care so long as he reaches the place where the pearls are. He also applies to Fonseca for licence to make discoveries; and$ duly receiving it$ sails from Palos in the beginning of June 1499$ hot upon the track of Ojeda.
Cockburn,Cockburn$ WA$ Australia,115.6391526,-32.0669485,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Thomas,Thomas County$ GA$ USA,-83.8473015,30.8417409,The immediate result of the capture of Caonabo was to rouse the islanders to further hostilities$ and one of the brothers of the captive king led a force of seven thousand men to the vicinity of St. Thomas$ to which Ojeda$ however$ had in the meantime returned. His small force was augmented by some men despatched by Bartholomew Columbus on receipt of an urgent message; and in command of this force Ojeda sallied forth against the natives and attacked them furiously on horse and on foot$ killing a great part of them$ taking others prisoner$ and putting the rest to flight. This was the beginning of the end of the island resistance. A month or two later$ when Columbus was better$ he and Bartholomew together mustered the whole of their available army and marched out in search of the native force$ which he knew had been rallied and greatly augmented.

Mediterranean,Mediterranean Sea,18.0480105,34.5531284,But promise and performance$ as no one knew better than Columbus$ are different things; and it was a long while before he got his ships. There was the usual scarcity of money$ and the extensive military and diplomatic operations in which the Crown was then engaged absorbed every maravedi that Ferdinand could lay his hands on. There was an army to be maintained under the Pyrenees to keep watch over France; fleets had to be kept patrolling both the Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards; and there was a whole armada required to convey the princesses of Spain and Austria to their respective husbands in connection with the double matrimonial alliance arranged between the two countries. And when at last$ in October 1496$ six million maravedis were provided wherewith Columbus might equip his fleet$ they were withdrawn again under very mortifying circumstances. The appropriation had just been made when a letter arrived from Pedro Nino$ who had been to Espanola and come back again$ and now wrote from Cadiz to the Sovereigns$ saying that his ships were full of gold. He did not present himself at Court$ but went to visit his family at Huelva; but the good news of his letter was accepted as an excuse for this oversight.
Canary,Canary $ United States,-124.0353922,43.9278985,The fleet as usual made the Canary Islands$ where they arrived on the 20th of May$ and stopped for five days taking in wood and water and fresh provisions. Columbus was himself againalways more himself at sea than anywhere else; he was following a now familiar road that had no difficulties or dangers for him; and there is no record of the voyage out except that it was quick and prosperous$ with the trade wind blowing so steadily that from the time they left the Canaries until they made land twenty days later they had hardly to touch a sheet or a halliard. The first land they made was the island of Martinique$ where wood and water were taken in and the men sent ashore to wash their linen. To young Ferdinand$ but fourteen years old$ this voyage was like a fairy tale come true$ and his delight in everything that he saw must have added greatly to Christophers pleasure and interest in the voyage. They only stayed a few days at Martinique and then sailed westward along the chain of islands until they came to Porto Rico$ where they put in to the sunny harbour which they had discovered on a former voyage.

Straits,San Jose $ United States,-121.9482408,37.3217492,After the shattering experience of the storm$ Columbus$ although he did not return to San Domingo$ remained for some time on the coast of Espanola repairing his ships and resting his exhausted crews. There were threatenings of another storm which delayed them still further$ and it was not until the middle of July that the Admiral was able to depart on the real purpose of his voyage. His object was to strike the mainland far to the westward of the Gulf of Paria$ and so by following it back eastward to find the passage which he believed to exist. But the winds and currents were very baffling; he was four days out of sight of land after touching at an island north of Jamaica; and finally$ in some bewilderment$ he altered his course more and more northerly until he found his whereabouts by coming in sight of the archipelago off the south-western end of Cuba which he had called the Gardens. From here he took a departure south-west$ and on the 30th of July came in sight of a small island off the northern coast of Honduras which he called Isla de Pinos$ and from which he could see the hills of the mainland. At this island he found a canoe of immense size with a sort of house or caboose built amidships$ in which was established a cacique with his family and dependents; and the people in the canoe showed signs of more advanced civilisation than any seen by Columbus before in these waters. They wore clothing$ they had copper hatchets$ and bells$ and palm-wood swords in the edges of which were set sharp blades of flint. They had a fermented liquor$ a kind of maize beer which looked like English ale; they had some kind of money or medium of exchange also$ and they told the Admiral that there was land to the west where all these things existed and many more. It is strange and almost inexplicable that he did not follow this trail to the westward; if he had done so he would have discovered Mexico. But one thing at a time always occupied him to the exclusion of everything else; his thoughts were now turned to the eastward$ where he supposed the Straits were; and the significance of this canoe full of natives was lost upon him.
Sefora,Tulsa $ United States,-95.881835,36.063267,Sir$The loneliness in which you have left us cannot be described.

Duplicates of everything will be completed and sent to you in the same manner and by the same Francisco. Among them you will find a new document. Their Highnesses promised to give all that belongs to me and to place Don Diego in possession of everything$ as you will see. I wrote to Senor Juan Luis and to Sefora Catalina. The letter accompanies this one. I am ready to start in the name of the Holy Trinity as soon as the weather is good. I am well provided with everything.

Cuevas,Santa María Cuevas $ Mexico,-99.0968066,19.8653741, He was in his fifty-sixth year$ already an old man in body and mind; and his death went entirely unmarked except by his immediate circle of friends. Even Peter Martyr$ who was in Valladolid just before and just after it$ and who was writing a series of letters to various correspondents giving all the news of his day$ never thought it worth while to mention that Christopher Columbus was dead. His life flickered out in the completest obscurity. It is not even known where he was first buried; but probably it was in the Franciscan convent at Valladolid. This$ however$ was only a temporary resting-place; and a few years later his body was formally interred in the choir of the monastery of Las Cuevas at Seville$ there to lie for thirty years surrounded by continual chauntings. After that it was translated to the cathedral in San Domingo; rested there for 250 years$ and then$ on the cession of that part of the island to France$ the body was removed to Cuba. But the Admiral was by this time nothing but a box of bones and dust$ as also were brother Bartholomew and son Diego$ and Diegos son$ all collected together in that place. There were various examinations of the bone-boxes; one$ supposed to be the Admirals$ was taken to Cuba and solemnly buried there; and lately$ after the conquest of the island in the Spanish-American War$ this box of bones was elaborately conveyed to Seville$ where it now rests.

Rodrigos,Temecula $ United States,-117.1434379,33.541725,The caravel had been sighted some time before$ probably when she was standing off$ the bar waiting for the tide; she was flying the Admirals flag and there was no mistaking her identity; and we can imagine the news spreading throughout the town of Palos$ and reaching Huelva$ and one by one the bells beginning to ring$ and the places of business to be closed$ and the people to come pouring out into the streets to be ready to greet their friends. Some more impatient than the others would sail out in fishing-boats to get the first news; and I should be surprised to know that a boat did not put off from the little pier beneath La Rabida$ to row round the point and out to where the Nina was lyingto beyond the Manto Bank. When the flood began to make over the bar and to cover the long sandbank that stretches from the island of Saltes$ the Nina came gliding in$ greeted by every joyful sound and signal that the inhabitants of the two seaports could make. Every one hurried down to Palos as the caravel rounded the Convent Point. Hernando$ Marchena$ and good old Juan Perez were all there$ we may be sure. Such excitements$ such triumphs as the bronzed$ white-bearded Admiral steps ashore at last$ and is seized by dozens of eager hands! Such excitements as all the wives and inamoratas of the Rodrigos and Juans and Franciscos rush to meet the swarthy voyagers and cover them with embraces; such disappointments also$ when it is realised that some two score of the company are still on a sunbaked island infinitely far over the western horizon.
Bello,Bello $ Colombia,-75.55958869999999,6.336728799999999,But he was not back in Espanola yet$ and his means for getting there were crumbling away beneath his feet. One of the three remaining caravels was entirely riddled by seaworms and had to be abandoned at the harbour called Puerto Bello; and the company was crowded on to two ships. The men now became more than ever discontented at the easterly course$ and on May 1st$ when he had come as far east as the Gulf of Darien$ Columbus felt obliged to bear away to the north$ although as it turned out he had not nearly made enough easting. He stood on this course$ for nine days$ the west-going current setting him down all the time; and the first land that he made$ on May 10th$ was the group of islands off the western end of Cuba which he had called the Queens Gardens.
Caribbean,Caribbean,-78.6568942,21.4691137,Ovando once gone$ the Admiral could turn again to his own affairs. It is true there were rumours that the whole fleet had perished$ for it encountered a gale very soon after leaving Cadiz$ and a great quantity of the deck hamper was thrown overboard and was washed on the shores of Spain; and the Sovereigns were so bitterly distressed that$ as it is said$ they shut them selves up for eight days. News eventually came$ however$ that only one ship had been lost and that the rest had proceeded safely to San Domingo. Columbus$ much recovered in body and mind$ now began to apply for a fleet for himself. He had heard of the discovery by the Portuguese of the southern route to India; no doubt he had heard also much gossip of the results of the many private voyages of discovery that were sailing from Spain at this time; and he began to think seriously about his own discoveries and the way in which they might best be extended. He thought much of his voyage to the west of Trinidad and of the strange pent-up seas and currents that he had discovered there. He remembered the continual westward trend of the current$ and how all the islands in that sea had their greatest length east and west$ as though their shores had been worn into that shape by the constant flowing of the current; and it was not an unnatural conclusion for him to suppose that there was a channel far to the west through which these seas poured and which would lead him to the Golden Chersonesus. He put away from him that nightmare madness that he transacted on the coast of Cuba. He knew very well that he had not yet found the Golden Chersonesus and the road to India; but he became convinced that the western current would lead him there if only he followed it long enough. There was nothing insane about this theory; it was in fact a very well-observed and well-reasoned argument; and the fact that it happened to be entirely wrong is no reflection on the Admirals judgment. The great Atlantic currents at that time had not been studied; and how could he know that the western stream of water was the northern half of a great ocean current which sweeps through the Caribbean Sea$ into and round the Gulf of Mexico$ and flows out northward past Florida in the Gulf Stream?
Oporto,Houston $ United States,-95.38026119999999,29.7531581,There was a state reception$ with Admiral Azumbaga walking in front in scarlet and brocade$ followed by his captains$ Columbus among them$ dressed in gorgeous tunics and cloaks with golden collars and$ well hidden beneath their finery$ good serviceable cuirasses. The banner of Portugal was ceremoniously unfurled and dis played from the top of a tall tree. An altar was erected and consecrated by the chaplain to the expedition$ and a mass was sung for the repose of the soul of Prince Henry. The Portugal contingent were then met by Caramansa$ the king of the country$ who came$ surrounded by a great guard of blacks armed with assegais$ their bodies scantily decorated with monkey fur and palm leaves. The black monarch must have presented a handsome appearance$ for his arms and legs were decked with gold bracelets and rings$ he had a kind of dog-collar fitted with bells round his neck$ and some pieces of gold were daintily twisted into his beard. With these aids to diplomacy$ and doubtless also with the help of a dram or two of spirits or of the wine of Oporto$ the treaty was soon concluded$ and a very shrewd stroke of business accomplished for the King of Portugal; for it gave him the sole right of exchanging gaudy rubbish from Portugal for the precious gold of Ethiopia. When the contents of the two freight-ships had been unloaded they were beached and broken up by the orders of King John$ who wished it to be thought that they had been destroyed in the whirlpools of that dangerous sea$ and that the navigation of those rough waters was only safe for the caravels of the Navy. The fort was built in twenty days$ and the expedition returned$ laden with gold and ivory; Admiral Azumbaga remained behind in command of the garrison.
Bernato,Villafranca di Verona $ Italy,10.8451365,45.3512739,If Christopher wanted to go down to the sea he would have to pass under the Gate of St. Andrew$ with the old prison$ now pulled down to make room for the modern buildings$ on his right$ and go down the Salita del Prione$ which is a continuation of the Vico Dritto di Ponticello. It slopes downwards from the Gate as the first street sloped upwards to it; and it contains the same assortment of shops and of houses$ the same mixture of handicrafts and industries$ as were seen in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello. Presently he would come to the Piazza dell Erbe$ where there is no grass$ but only a pleasant circle of little houses and shops$ with already a smack of the sea in them$ chiefly suggested by the shops of instrument-makers$ where to-day there are compasses and sextants and chronometers. Out of the Piazza you come down the Via di San Donato and into the Piazza of that name$ where for over nine centuries the church of San Donato has faced the sun and the weather. From there Christophers young feet would follow the winding Via di San Bernato$ a street also inhabited by craftsmen and workers in wood and metal; and at the last turn of it$ a gash of blue between the two cliffwalls of houses$ you see the Mediterranean.
Bayona,New Orleans $ United States,-90.0680821,29.9573148,And in the evening$ with the last of the flood$ another ship comes gliding round the point and up the estuary. The inhabitants of Palos have all left the shore and are absorbed in the business of welcoming the great man; and there is no one left to notice or welcome the Pinta. For it is she that$ by a strange coincidence$ and after many dangers and distresses endured since she had parted company from the Nina in the storm$ now has made her native port on the very same day as the Nina. Our old friend Martin Alonso Pinzon is on board$ all the fight and treachery gone out of him$ and anxious only to get home unobserved. For (according to the story) he had made the port of Bayona on the north-west coast of Spain$ and had written a letter from there to the Sovereigns announcing his arrival and the discoveries that he had made; and it is said that he had received an unpleasant letter in return$ reproaching him for not waiting for his commander and forbidding him to come to Court. This story is possible if his letter reached the Sovereigns after the letter from the Admiral; for it is probable that Columbus may have reported some of Martins doings to them.
Toledo,Toledo $ United States,-83.55521200000001,41.6639383,During his stay at Barcelona Columbus was the guest of the Cardinal-Archbishop of Toledo$ and moved thus in an atmosphere of combined temporal and spiritual dignity such as his soul loved. Very agreeable indeed to him was the honour shown to him at this time. Deep down in his heart there was a secret nerve of pride and vanity which throughout his life hitherto had been continually mortified and wounded; but he was able now to indulge his appetite for outward pomp and honour as much as he pleased. When King Ferdinand went out to ride Columbus would be seen riding on one side of him$ the young Prince John riding on the other side; and everywhere$ when he moved among the respectful and admiring throng$ his grave face was seen to be wreathed in complacent smiles. His hair$ which had turned white soon after he was thirty$ gave him a dignified and almost venerable appearance$ although he was only in his forty-third year; and combined with his handsome and commanding presence to excite immense enthusiasm among the Spaniards. They forgot for the moment what they had formerly remembered and were to remember againthat he was a foreigner$ an Italian$ a man of no family and of poor origin. They saw in him the figure-head of a new empire and a new glory$ an emblem of power and riches$ of the dominion which their proud souls loved; and so there beamed upon him the brief fickle sunshine of their smiles and favour$ which he in his delusion regarded as an earnest of their permanent honour and esteem.

In the year 983 the coast of Greenland was visited by Eric the Red$ the son of a Norwegian noble$ who was banished for the crime of murder. Some fifteen years later Erics son Lief made an expedition with thirty-five men and a ship in the direction of the new land. They came to a coast where there were nothing but ice mountains having the appearance of slate; this country they named Hellulandthat is$ Land of Slate. This country is our Newfoundland. Standing out to sea again$ they reached a level wooded country with white sandy cliffs$ which they called Markland$ or Land of Wood$ which is our Nova Scotia. Next they reached an island east of Markland$ where they passed the winter$ and as one of their number who had wandered some distance inland had found vines and grapes$ Lief named the country Vinland or Vine Land$ which is the country we call New England. The Scandinavians continued to make voyages to the West and South; and finally Thorfinn Karlsefne$ an Icelander$ made a great expedition in the spring of 1007 with ships and material for colonisation. He made much progress to the southwards$ and the Icelandic accounts of the climate and soil and characteristics of the country leave no doubt that Greenland and Nova Scotia were discovered and colonised at this time.

Pacific,Stockton $ United States,-121.3120225,37.9808152,This conception of the world excluded the Pacific Ocean and the continent of North and South America$ and made it reasonable to suppose that any one who sailed westward long enough from Spain would ultimately reach Cathay and the Indies. Behaims globe$ which was completed in the year 1492$ represented the farthest point that geographical knowledge had reached previous to the discoveries of Columbus$ and on it is shown the island of Cipango or Japan.
Grand,Grand County$ CO$ USA,-106.0640179,40.0727382,The commission given to Aguado was very brief$ and so vaguely worded that it might mean much or little$ according to the discretion of the commissioner and the necessities of the case as viewed by him. We send to you Juan Aguada$ our Groom of the Chambers$ who will speak to you on our part. We command you to give him faith and credit. A letter was also sent to Columbus in which he was instructed to reduce the number of people dependent on the colony to five hundred instead of a thousand; and the control of the mines was entrusted to one Pablo Belvis$ who was sent out as chief metallurgist. As for the slaves that Columbus had sent home$ Isabella forbade their sale until inquiry could be made into the condition of their capture$ and the fine moral point involved was entrusted to the ecclesiastical authorities for examination and solution. Poor Christopher$ knowing as he did that five hundred heretics were being burned every year by the Grand Inquisitor$ had not expected this hair-splitting over the fate of heathens who had rebelled against Spanish authority; and it caused him some distress when he heard of it. The theologians$ however$ proved equal to the occasion$ and the slaves were duly sold in Seville market.

East,Wichita $ United States,-97.30900280000002,37.6845131,The man himself was a simple man; capable$ when the whole of his various qualities were directed upon one single thing$ of that greatness which is the crown of simplicity. Ambition was the keynote of his life; not an unworthy keynote$ by any means$ if only the ambition be sound; but one serious defect of Columbuss ambition was that it was retrospective rather than perspective. He may have had$ before he sailed from Palos$ an ambition to be the discoverer of a New World; but I do not think he had. He believed there were islands or land to be discovered in the West if only he pushed on far enough; and he was ambitious to find them and vindicate his belief. Afterwards$ when he had read a little more$ and when he conceived the plan of pretending that he had all along meant to discover the Indies and a new road to the East$ he acted in accordance with that pretence; he tried to make his acts appear retrospectively as though they had been prompted by a design quite different from that by which they had really been prompted. When he found that his discovery was regarded as a great scientific feat$ he made haste to pretend that it had all along been meant as such$ and was in fact the outcome of an elaborate scientific theory. In all this there is nothing for praise or admiration. It indicates the presence of moral disease; but fortunately it is functional rather than organic disease. He was right and sound at heart; but he spread his sails too readily to the great winds of popular favour$ and the result was instability to himself$ and often danger of shipwreck to his soul.
Paria,Paria $ United States,-111.943901,37.251438,While Mendez was making his preparations$ putting a false keel on the canoe and fixing weather boards along its gunwales to prevent its shipping seas$ fitting a mast and sail and giving it a coat of tar$ the Admiral retired into his cabin and busied himself with his pen. He wrote one letter to Ovando briefly describing his circumstances and requesting that a ship should be sent for his relief; and another to the Sovereigns$ in which a long rambling account was given of the events of the voyage$ and much other matter besides$ dismally eloquent of his floundering in the quag. Much in itabout Solomon and Josephus$ of the Abbot Joachim$ of Saint Jerome and the Great Khan; more about the Holy Sepulchre and the intentions of the Almighty in that matter; with some serious practical concern for the rich land of Veragua which he had discovered$ lest it should share the fate of his other discoveries and be eaten up by idle adventurers. Veragua$ he says$ is not a little son which may be given to a stepmother to nurse. Of Espanola and Paria and all the other lands I never think without the tears falling from my eyes; I believe that the example of these ought to serve for the others. And then this passage:
Red,Menomonie $ United States,-91.93156809999999,44.88084,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Rica,Rico $ United States,-108.0303502,37.6927729,The natives at this anchorage of Cariari were rather suspicious$ but Columbus seized two of them to act as guides in his journey further down the coast. Weighing anchor on October 5th he worked along the Costa Rica shore$ which here turns to the eastward again$ and soon found a tribe of natives who wore large ornaments of gold. They were reluctant to part with the gold$ but as usual pointed down the coast and said that there was much more gold there; they even gave a name to the place where the gold could be foundVeragua; and for once this country was found to have a real existence. The fleet anchored there on October 17th$ being greeted by defiant blasts of conch shells and splashing of water from the indignant natives. Business was done$ however: seventeen gold discs in exchange for three hawks bells.
Caribs,Kingston $ Jamaica,-76.78892200000001,17.992623,It will be remembered that he had been obliged to hurry away from Espanola without visiting the islands of the Caribs as he had wished to do. He knew that these islands lay to the south-east of Espanola$ and on his second voyage he therefore took a course rather more southerly in order$ to make them instead of Guanahani or Espanola. From the day they left Spain his ships had pleasant light airs from the east and north-east which wafted them steadily but slowly on their course. In a week they had reached the Grand Canary$ where they paused to make some repairs to one of the ships which$ was leaking. Two days later they anchored at Gomera$ and loaded up with such supplies as could be procured there better than in Spain. Pigs$ goats$ sheep and cows were taken on board; domestic fowls also$ and a variety of orchard plants and fruit seeds$ as well as a provision of oranges$ lemons$ and melons. They sailed from Gomera on the 7th of October$ but the winds were so light that it was a week later before they had passed Ferro and were once more in the open Atlantic.
Good,Los Angeles $ United States,-118.368213,34.063464,Another great conquest of the salt unknown taken place a few days before Columbus sailed on his third voyage. The accidental discovery of the Cape by Bartholomew Diaz in 1486 had not been neglected by Portugal; and the achievements of Columbus$ while they cut off Portuguese enterprise from the western ocean$ had only stimulated it to greater activity within its own spheres. Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon in July 1497; by the end of November he had rounded the Cape of Good Hope; and in May 1498$ after a long voyage full of interest$ peril$ and hardship he had landed at Calicut on the shores of the true India. He came back in 1499 with a battered remnant$ his crew disabled by sickness and exhaustion$ and half his ships lost; but he had in fact discovered a road for trade and adventure to the East that was not paved with promises$ dreams$ or mad affidavits$ but was a real and tangible achievement$ bringing its reward in commerce and wealth for Portugal. At that very moment Columbus was groping round the mainland of South America$ thinking it to be the coast of Cathay$ and the Garden of Eden$ and God knows what other cosmographicaltheological abstractions; and Portugal$ busy with her arrangements for making money$ could afford for the moment to look on undismayed at the development of the mine of promises discovered by the Spanish Admiral.
Veragua,Veragua $ Dominican Republic,-70.3688031,19.6566819,While Mendez was making his preparations$ putting a false keel on the canoe and fixing weather boards along its gunwales to prevent its shipping seas$ fitting a mast and sail and giving it a coat of tar$ the Admiral retired into his cabin and busied himself with his pen. He wrote one letter to Ovando briefly describing his circumstances and requesting that a ship should be sent for his relief; and another to the Sovereigns$ in which a long rambling account was given of the events of the voyage$ and much other matter besides$ dismally eloquent of his floundering in the quag.

Veragua$ he says$ is not a little son which may be given to a stepmother to nurse. Of Espanola and Paria and all the other lands I never think without the tears falling from my eyes; I believe that the example of these ought to serve for the others. And then this passage:
Xaragua,Montrouis $ Haiti,-72.70824999999999,18.949514,All these things Diego Mendez had to witness; and when they were over$ Ovando still had excuses for not hurrying to the relief of the Admiral. He had embarked on a campaign of extermination against the natives$ and he followed up his atrocities at Xaragua by an expedition to the eastern end of Espanola$ where very much the same kind of business was transacted. Weeks and months passed in this bloody cruelty$ and there was always an excuse for putting off Mendez. Now it was because of the operations which he dignified by the name of wars$ and now because he had no ship suitable for sending to Jamaica; but the truth was that Ovando$ the springs of whose humanity had been entirely dried up during his disastrous reign in Espanola$ did not want Columbus to see with his own eyes the terrible state of the island$ and was callous enough to leave him either to perish or to find his own way back to the world. It was only when news came that a fleet of caravels was expected from Spain that Ovando could no longer prevent Mendez from going to San Domingo and$ purchasing one of them.
Amazon,Brampton $ Canada,-79.79472249999999,43.6084582,Yet another of our old friends profited by the Admirals discovery. What Vincenti Yafiez Pinzon has been doing all these years we have no record; living at Palos$ perhaps$ doing a little of his ordinary coasting business$ administering the estates of his brother Martin Alonso$ and$ almost for a certainty$ talking pretty big about who it was that really did all the work in the discovery of the New World. Out of the obscurity of conjecture he emerges into fact in December 1499$ when he is found at Palos fitting out four caravels for the purpose of exploring farther along the coast of the southern mainland. That he also was after pearls is pretty certain; but on the other hand he was more of a sailor than an adventurer$ was a discoverer at heart$ and had no small share of the family taste for sea travel. He took a more southerly course than any of the others and struck the coast of America south of the equator on January 20$ 1500. He sailed north past the mouths of the Amazon and Orinoco through the Gulf of Paria$ and reached Espanola in June 1500. He only paused there to take in provisions$ and sailed to the west in search of further discoveries; but he lost two of his caravels in a gale and had to put back to Espanola.
Cape,Owasso $ United States,-95.8522595,36.2589621,Late in the night$ however$ the moon rose$ and Mendez had the joy of seeing its lower disc cut by a jagged line which proved to be the little islet or rock of Navassa$ which lies off the westerly end of Espanola. New hope now animated the sufferers$ and they pushed on until they were able to land on this rock$ which proved to be without any vegetation whatsoever$ but on the surface of which there were found some precious pools of rain-water. Mendez was able to restrain the frantic appetites of his fellow-countrymen$ but the savage companions were less wise$ and drank their fill; so that some of them died in torment on the spot$ and others became seriously ill. The Spaniards were able to make a fire of driftwood$ and boil some shell-fish$ which they found on shore$ and they wisely spent the heat of the day crouching in the shade of the rocks$ and put off their departure until the evening. It was then a comparatively easy journey for them to cross the dozen miles that separated them from Espanola$ and they landed the next day in a pleasant harbour near Cape Tiburon. Fieschi$ true to his promise$ was then ready to start back for Jamaica with news of the safe accomplishment of the voyage; but the remnant of the crews$ Spaniards and savage companions alike$ had had enough of it$ and no threats or persuasions would induce them to embark again. Mendez$ therefore$ left his friends to enjoy some little repose before continuing their journey to San Domingo$ and$ taking six natives of Espanola to row his canoe; set off along the coast towards the capital. He had not gone half-way when he learned that Ovando was not there$ but was in Xaragua$ so he left his canoe and struck northward through the forest until he arrived at the Governors camp.
Indus,Indus River,73.4642801,29.9045182,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan.

America,United States,-95.712891,37.09024,This letter has a significance which raises it out of the ruck of this complaining correspondence. Amerigo Vespucci had just returned from his long voyage in the West$ when he had navigated along an immense stretch of the coast of America$ both north and south$ and had laid the foundations of a fame which was$ for a time at least$ to eclipse that of Columbus. Probably neither of the two men realised it at this interview$ or Columbus would hardly have felt so cordially towards the man who was destined to rob him of so much glory. As a matter of fact the practical Spaniards were now judging entirely by results; and a year or two later$ when the fame of Columbus had sunk to insignificance$ he was merely referred to as the discoverer of certain islands$ while Vespucci$ who after all had only followed in his lead$ was hailed as the discoverer of a great continent. Vespucci has been unjustly blamed for this state of affairs$ although he could no more control the public estimate of his services than Columbus could. He was a more practical man than Columbus$ and he made a much better impression on really wise and intelligent men; and his discoveries were immediately associated with trade and colonial development$ while Columbus had little to show for his discoveries during his lifetime but a handful of gold dust and a few cargoes of slaves. At any rate it was a graceful act on the part of Vespucci$ whose star was in the ascendant$ to go and seek out the Admiral$ whose day was fast verging to night; it was one of those disinterested actions that live and have a value of their own$ and that shine out happily amid the surrounding murk and confusion.
Fort,Durango $ United States,-107.8710381,37.2737453,Christopher at Fort Concepcion had early news of the arrival of Bobadilla$ but in the hazy state of his mind he did not regard it as an event of sufficient importance to make his immediate presence at San Domingo advisable. The name of Bobadilla conveyed nothing to him; and when he heard that he had come to investigate$ he thought that he came to set right some disputed questions between the Admiral and other navigators as to the right of visiting Espanola and the Paria coast. As the days went on$ however$ he heard more disquieting rumours; grew at last uneasy$ and moved to a fort nearer San Domingo in case it should be necessary for him to go there. An officer met him on the road bearing the proclamations issued by Bobadilla$ but not the message from the Sovereigns requiring the Admirals obedience to the commissioner. Columbus wrote to the commissioner a curious letter$ which is not preserved$ in which he sought to gain time; excusing himself from responsibility for the condition of the island$ and assuring Bobadilla that$ as he intended to return to Spain almost immediately$ he (Bobadilla) would have ample opportunity for exercising his command in his absence. He also wrote to the Franciscan friars who had accompanied Bobadilla asking them to use their influencethe Admiral having some vague connection with the Franciscan order since his days at La Rabida.
Southampton,Southampton $ United Kingdom,-1.4043509,50.90970040000001,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Isabella,Isabella $ United States,-98.34007299999999,36.2355913,The five chiefs who had ruled with justice and wisdom over the island of Espanola in the early days of Columbus were all dead$ wiped out by the wave of wild death and cruelty that had swept over the island. The gentle Guacanagari$ when he saw the desolation that was beginning to overwhelm human existence$ had fled into the mountains$ hiding his face in shame from the sons of men$ and had miserably died there. Caonabo$ Lord of the House of Gold$ fiercest and bravest of them all$ who first realised that the Spaniards were enemies to the native peace$ after languishing in prison in the house of Columbus at Isabella for some time$ had died in captivity during the voyage to Spain. Anacaona his wife$ the Bloom of the Gold$ that brave and beautiful woman$ whose admiration of the Spaniards had by their bloody cruelties been turned into detestation$ had been shamefully betrayed and ignominiously hanged. Behechio$ her brother$ the only cacique who did not sue for peace after the first conquest of the island by Christopher and Bartholomew Columbus$ was dead long ago of wounds and sorrow. Guarionex$ the Lord of the Vega Real$ who had once been friendly enough$ who had danced to the Spanish pipe and learned the Paternoster and Ave Maria$ and whose progress in conversion to Christianity the seduction of his wives by those who were converting him had interrupted$ after wandering in the mountains of Ciguay had been imprisoned in chains$ and drowned in the hurricane of June 30$ 1502.
Domingo,Dominican Republic,-70.162651,18.735693,But in the meanwhile the Chapter of the cathedral in San Domingo had made new discoveries and examinations; had found another box of bones$ which bore to them authentic signs that the dust it contained was the Admirals and not his grandsons; and in spite of the Academy of History at Madrid$ it is indeed far from unlikely that the Admirals dust does not lie in Spain or Cuba$ but in San Domingo still. Whole books have been written about these boxes of bones; learned societies have argued about them$ experts have examined the bones and the boxes with microscopes; and meantime the dust of Columbus$ if we take the view that an error was committed in the transference to Cuba$ is not even collected all in one box. A sacrilegious official acquired some of it when the boxes were opened$ and distributed it among various curiosity-hunters$ who have preserved it in caskets of crystal and silver. Thus a bit of him is worn by an American lady in a crystal locket; a pinch of him lies in a glass vial in a New York mansion; other pinches in the Lennox Library$ New York$ in the Vatican$ and in the University of Pavia. In such places$ if the Admiral should fail to appear at the first note of their trumpets$ must the Angels of the Resurrection make search.
Campo,Austin $ United States,-97.7227807,30.2912379,Thus passed the summer and autumn of 1487; precious months$ precious years slipping by$ and the great purpose as yet unfulfilled and seemingly no nearer to fulfilment. It is likely that Columbus kept up his applications to the Court$ and received polite and delaying replies. The next year came$ and the Court migrated from Zaragoza to Murcia$ from Murcia to Valladolid$ from Valladolid to Medina del Campo. Columbus attended it in one or other of these places$ but without result. In August Beatriz gave birth to a son$ who was christened Ferdinand$ and who lived to be a great comfort to his father$ if not to her also. But the miracle of paternity was not now so new and wonderful as it had been; the battle of life$ with its crosses and difficulties$ was thick about him; and perhaps he looked into this new-comers small face with conflicting thoughts$ and memories of the long white beach and the crashing surf at Porto Santo$ and regret for things lostso strangely mingled and inconsistent are the threads of human thought. At last he decided to turn his face elsewhere. In September 1488 he went to Lisbon$ for what purpose it is not certain; possibly in connection with the affairs of his dead wife; and probably also in the expectation of seeing his brother Bartholomew$ to whom we may now turn our attention for a moment.
Cadiz,Cádiz $ Spain,-6.2885962,36.5270612,Columbuss ships were on the point of sailing when word came that the Moors were besieging a Portuguese post on the coast of Morocco$ and$ as civility was now the order of the day between Spain and Portugal$ the Admiral was instructed to call on his way there and afford some relief. This he did$ sailing from Cadiz on the 9th or 10th of May to Ercilla on the Morocco coast$ where he anchored on the 13th. But the Moors had all departed and the siege was over; so Columbus$ having sent Bartholomew and some of his officers ashore on a civil visit$ which was duly returned$ set out the same day on his last voyage.
Bahama,The Bahamas,-77.39627999999999,25.03428,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Florida,Florida$ USA,-81.5157535,27.6648274,Ovando once gone$ the Admiral could turn again to his own affairs. It is true there were rumours that the whole fleet had perished$ for it encountered a gale very soon after leaving Cadiz$ and a great quantity of the deck hamper was thrown overboard and was washed on the shores of Spain; and the Sovereigns were so bitterly distressed that$ as it is said$ they shut them selves up for eight days. News eventually came$ however$ that only one ship had been lost and that the rest had proceeded safely to San Domingo. Columbus$ much recovered in body and mind$ now began to apply for a fleet for himself. He had heard of the discovery by the Portuguese of the southern route to India; no doubt he had heard also much gossip of the results of the many private voyages of discovery that were sailing from Spain at this time; and he began to think seriously about his own discoveries and the way in which they might best be extended. He thought much of his voyage to the west of Trinidad and of the strange pent-up seas and currents that he had discovered there. He remembered the continual westward trend of the current$ and how all the islands in that sea had their greatest length east and west$ as though their shores had been worn into that shape by the constant flowing of the current; and it was not an unnatural conclusion for him to suppose that there was a channel far to the west through which these seas poured and which would lead him to the Golden Chersonesus. He put away from him that nightmare madness that he transacted on the coast of Cuba. He knew very well that he had not yet found the Golden Chersonesus and the road to India; but he became convinced that the western current would lead him there if only he followed it long enough. There was nothing insane about this theory; it was in fact a very well-observed and well-reasoned argument; and the fact that it happened to be entirely wrong is no reflection on the Admirals judgment. The great Atlantic currents at that time had not been studied; and how could he know that the western stream of water was the northern half of a great ocean current which sweeps through the Caribbean Sea$ into and round the Gulf of Mexico$ and flows out northward past Florida in the Gulf Stream?
Loretto,Loretto $ United States,-93.6355165,45.0546855,A great quantity of birds that began to fly about the ship made him think that they were near land$ but they turned out to be the harbingers of a storm. On Tuesday$ February 12th$ the sea and wind began to rise$ and it continued to blow harder throughout that night and the next day. The wind being aft he went under bare poles most of the night$ and when day came hoisted a little sail; but the sea was terrible$ and if he had not been so sure of the staunch little Nina he would have felt himself in danger of being lost. The next day the sea$ instead of going down$ increased in roughness; there was a heavy cross sea which kept breaking right over the ship$ and it became necessary to make a little sail in order to run before the wind$ and to prevent the vessel falling back into the trough of the seas. All through Thursday he ran thus under the half hoisted staysail$ and he could see the Pinta running also before the wind$ although since she presented more surface$ and was able to carry a little more sail than the Nina$ she was soon lost to sight. The Admiral showed lights through the night$ and this time there was no lack of response from Martin Alonso; and for some part of that dark and stormy night these two humanly freighted scraps of wood and cordage staggered through the gale showing lights to each other; until at last the light from the Pinta disappeared. When morning came she was no longer to be seen; and the wind and the sea had if anything increased. The Nina was now in the greatest danger. Any one wave of the heavy cross sea$ if it had broken fairly across her$ would have sunk her; and she went swinging and staggering down into the great valleys and up into the hills$ the steersmans heart in his mouth$ and the whole crew in an extremity of fear. Columbus$ who generally relied upon his seamanship$ here invoked external aid$ and began to offer bargains to the Almighty. He ordered that lots should be cast$ and that he upon whom the lot fell should make a vow to go on pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Guadaloupe carrying a white candle of five pounds weight. Same dried peas were brought$ one for every member of the crew$ and on one of them a cross was marked with a knife; the peas were well shaken and were put into a cap. The first to draw was the Admiral; he drew the marked pea$ and he made the vow. Lots were again drawn$ this time for a greater pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Loretto in Ancona; and the lot fell on a seaman named Pedro de Villa$the expenses of whose pilgrimage Columbus promised to pay. Again lots were drawn for a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Clara of Moguer$ the pilgrim to watch and pray for one night there; and again the lot fell on Columbus. In addition to these$ every one$ since they took themselves for lost$ made some special and private vow or bargain with God; and finally they all made a vow together that at the first land they reached they would go in procession in their shirts to pray at an altar of Our Lady.
Belem,Belém $ Brazil,-48.4901968,-1.4557794,After experiencing some terrible weather$ in the course of which they had been obliged to catch sharks for food and had once been nearly overwhelmed by a waterspout$ they entered a harbour where$ in the words of young Ferdinand$ we saw the people living like birds in the tops of the trees$ laying sticks across from bough to bough and building their huts upon them; and though we knew not the reason of the custom we guessed that it was done for fear of their enemies$ or of the griffins that are in this island. After further experiences of bad weather they made what looked like a suitable harbour on the coast of Veragua$ which harbour$ as they entered it on the day of the Epiphany (January 9$ 1503)$ they named Belem or Bethlehem. The river in the mouth of which they were anchored$ however$ was subject to sudden spouts and gushes of water from the hills$ one of which occurred on January 24th and nearly swamped the caravels. This spout of water was caused by the rainy season$ which had begun in the mountains and presently came down to the coast$ where it rained continuously until the 14th of February. They had made friends with the Quibian or chief of the country$ and he had offered to conduct them to the place where the gold mines were; so Bartholomew was sent off in the rain with a boat party to find this territory. It turned out afterwards that the cunning Quibian had taken them out of his own country and showed them the gold mined of a neighbouring chief$ which were not so rich as his own.
Estevan,Estevan $ Canada,-102.9914806,49.1390842,This new disappointment$ bitter though it was$ did not find Columbus in such friendless and unhappy circumstances as those in which he left Portugal. He had important friends now$ who were willing and anxious to help him$ and among them was one to whom he turned$ in his profound depression$ for religious and friendly consolation. This was Diego de DEA$ prior of the Dominican convent of San Estevan at Salamanca$ who was also professor of theology in the university there and tutor to the young Prince Juan. Of all those who came in contact with Columbus at this time this man seems to have understood him best$ and to have realised where his difficulty lay. Like many others who are consumed with a burning idea Columbus was very probably at this time in danger of becoming possessed with it like a monomaniac; and his new friends saw that if he were to make any impression upon the conservative learning of the time to which a decision in such matters was always referred he must have some opportunity for friendly discussion with learned men who were not inimical to him$ and who were not in the position of judges examining a man arraigned before them and pleading for benefits.

Islands,Iceland,-19.020835,64.963051,The fleet as usual made the Canary Islands$ where they arrived on the 20th of May$ and stopped for five days taking in wood and water and fresh provisions. Columbus was himself againalways more himself at sea than anywhere else; he was following a now familiar road that had no difficulties or dangers for him; and there is no record of the voyage out except that it was quick and prosperous$ with the trade wind blowing so steadily that from the time they left the Canaries until they made land twenty days later they had hardly to touch a sheet or a halliard. The first land they made was the island of Martinique$ where wood and water were taken in and the men sent ashore to wash their linen. To young Ferdinand$ but fourteen years old$ this voyage was like a fairy tale come true$ and his delight in everything that he saw must have added greatly to Christophers pleasure and interest in the voyage. They only stayed a few days at Martinique and then sailed westward along the chain of islands until they came to Porto Rico$ where they put in to the sunny harbour which they had discovered on a former voyage.
Pradella,West End $ Australia,153.0010814,-27.4858584,Christopher is gone$ vanished over that blue horizon; and the tale of life in Genoa goes on without him very much as before$ except that Domenico has one apprentice less$ and$ a matter becoming of some importance in the narrow condition of his finances$ one boy less to feed and clothe. For good Domenico$ alas! is no economist. Those hardy adventures of his in the buying and selling line do not prosper him; the tavern does not pay; perhaps the tavern-keeper is too hospitable; at any rate$ things are not going well. And yet Domenico had a good start; as his brother Antonio has doubtless often told him$ he had the best of old Giovannis inheritance; he had the property at Quinto$ and other property at Ginestreto$ and some ground rents at Pradella; a tavern at Savona$ a shop there and at Genoareally$ Domenico has no excuse for his difficulties. In 1445 he was selling land at Quinto$ presumably with the consent of old Giovanni$ if he was still alive; and if he was not living$ then immediately after his death$ in the first pride of possession.
Giorgio,Laval $ Canada,-73.7425362,45.5720021,It is another illustration of the way in which discovery and imagination had hitherto gone by steps and not by flights$ that geographical knowledge reached the islands of the Atlantic (none of which were at a very great distance from the coast of Europe or from each other) at a comparatively early date$ and stopped there until in Columbus there was found a man with faith strong enough to make the long flight beyond them to the unknown West. And yet the philosophers$ and later the cartographers$ true to their instinct for this pedestrian kind of imagination$ put mythical lands and islands to the westward of the known islands as though they were really trying to make a way$ to sink stepping stones into the deep sea that would lead their thoughts across the unknown space. In the Catalan map of the world$ which was the standard example of cosmography in the early days of Columbus$ most of these mythical islands are marked. There was the island of Antilia$ which was placed in 25 deg. 35 W.$ and was said to have been discovered by Don Roderick$ the last of the Gothic kings of Spain$ who fled there after his defeat by the Moors. There was the island of the Seven Cities$ which is sometimes identified with this Antilia$ and was the object of a persistent belief or superstition on the part of the inhabitants of the Canary Islands. They saw$ or thought they saw$ about ninety leagues to the westward$ an island with high peaks and deep valleys. The vision was intermittent; it was only seen in very clear weather$ on some of those pure$ serene days of the tropics when in the clear atmosphere distant objects appear to be close at hand. In cloudy$ and often in clear weather also$ it was not to be seen at all; but the inhabitants of the Canaries$ who always saw it in the same place$ were so convinced of its reality that they petitioned the King of Portugal to allow them to go and take possession of it; and several expeditions were in fact despatched$ but none ever came up with that fairy land. It was called the island of the Seven Cities from a legend of seven bishops who had fled from Spain at the time of the Moorish conquest$ and$ landing upon this island$ had founded there seven splendid cities. There was the island of St. Brandan$ called after the Saint who set out from Ireland in the sixth century in search of an island which always receded before his ships; this island was placed several hundred miles to the west of the Canaries on maps and charts through out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was the island of Brazil$ to the west of Cape St. Vincent; the islands of Royllo$ San Giorgio$ and Isola di Mam; but they were all islands of dreams$ seen by the eyes of many mariners in that imaginative time$ but never trodden by any foot of man. To Columbus$ however$ and the mariners of his day$ they were all real places$ which a man might reach by special good fortune or heroism$ but which$ all things considered$ it was not quite worth the while of any man to attempt to reach. They have all disappeared from our charts$ like the Atlantis of Plato$ that was once charted to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar$ and of which the Canaries were believed to be the last peaks unsubmerged.
Monte,Monte Partido$ Buenos Aires Province$ Argentina,-58.8289611,-35.4212385,The most urgent need was to build the new settlement and lay out a town. Several small parties were sent out to reconnoitre the coast in both directions$ but none of them found a suitable place; and on December 7th the whole fleet sailed to the east in the hope of finding a better position. They were driven by adverse winds into a harbour some thirty miles to the east of Monte Christi$ and when they went ashore they decided that this was as good a site as any for the new town. There was about a quarter of a mile of level sandy beach enclosed by headlands on either side; there was any amount of rock and stones for building$ and there was a natural barrier of hills and mountains a mile or so inland that would protect a camp from that side.The soil was very fertile$ the vegetation luxuriant; and the mango swamps a little way inland drained into a basin or lake which provided an unlimited water supply. Columbus therefore set about establishing a little town$ to which he gave the name of Isabella. Streets and squares were laid out$ and rows of temporary buildings made of wood and thatched with grass were hastily run up for the accommodation of the members of the expedition$ while the foundations of three stone buildings were also marked out and the excavations put in hand. These buildings were the church$ the storehouse$ and a residence for Columbus as Governor-General. The stores were landed$ the horses and cattle accommodated ashore$ the provisions$ ammunition$ and agricultural implements also. Labourers were set to digging out the foundations of the stone buildings$ carpenters to cutting down trees and running up the light wooden houses that were to serve as barracks for the present; masons were employed in hewing stones and building landing-piers; and all the crowd of well-born adventurers were set to work with their hands$ much to their disgust. This was by no means the life they had imagined$ and at the first sign of hard work they turned sulky and discontented. There was$ to be sure$ some reason for their discontent. Things had not quite turned out as Columbus had promised they should; there was no store of gold$ nor any sign of great desire on the part of the natives to bring any; and to add to their other troubles$ illness began to break out in the camp. The freshly-turned rank soil had a bad effect on the health of the garrison; the lake$ which had promised to be so pleasant a feature in the new town$ gave off dangerous malarial vapours at night; and among the sufferers from this trouble was Columbus himself$ who endured for some weeks all the pains and lassitude of the disagreeable fever.
Portugal,Portugal,-8.224454,39.39987199999999,Some time after this letter was written$ and before the writing of the next$ news reached Seville of the death of Queen Isabella. For ten years her kind heart had been wrung by many sorrows. Her mother had died in 1496; the next year her only son and heir to the crown had followed; and within yet another year had died her favourite daughter$ the Queen of Portugal. Her other children were all scattered with the exception of Juana$ whose semi-imbecile condition caused her parents an anxiety greater even than that caused by death. As Isabellas life thus closed sombrely in$ she applied herself more closely and more narrowly to such pious consolations as were available. News from Flanders of the scandalous scenes between Philip and Juana in the summer of 1504 brought on an illness from which she really never recovered$ a kind of feverish distress of mind and body in which her only alleviation was the transaction of such business as was possible for her in the direction of humanity and enlightenment. She still received men of intellect and renown$ especially travellers. But she knew that her end was near$ and as early as October she had made her will$ in which her wishes as to the succession and government of Castile were clearly laid down. There was no mention of Columbus in this will$ which afterwards greatly mortified him; but it is possible that the poor Queen had by this time$ even against her wish$ come to share the opinions of her advisers that the rule of Columbus in the West Indies had not brought the most humane and happy results possible to the people there.
Pines,San Diego $ United States,-117.2425164,32.8787816,Perhaps in his madness he would really have gone on and tried to reach the Golden Chersonesus of Ptolemy$ which according to Marco Polo lay just beyond$ and so to steer homeward round Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope; in which case he would either have been lost or would have discovered Mexico. The crews$ however$ would not hear of the voyage being continued westward. The ships were leaking and the salt water was spoiling the already doubtful provisions and he was forced to turn back. He stood to the south-east$ and reached the Isle of Pines$ to which he gave the name of Evangelista$ where the water-casks were filled$ and from there he tried to sail back to the east. But he found himself surrounded by islands and banks in every direction$ which made any straight course impossible. He sailed south and east and west and north$ and found himself always back again in the middle of this charmed group of islands. He spent almost a month trying to escape from them$ and once his ship went ashore on a sandbank and was only warped off with the greatest difficulty. On July 7th he was back again in the region of the Queens Gardens$ from which he stood across to the coast of Cuba.
Strait,Atlanta $ United States,-84.4390568,33.6403546,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.

Chio,Chios 821 00,26.1363457,38.3709813,In this faith$ then$ and with this equipment$ and about the year 1465$ Christopher Columbus began his sea travels. His voyages would be doubtless at first much along the coasts$ and across to Alexandria and the Islands. There would be returnings to Genoa$ and glad welcomings by the little household in the narrow street; in 1472 and 1473 he was with his father at Savona$ helping with the wool-weaving and tavern-keeping; possibly also there were interviews with Benincasa$ who was at that time living in Genoa$ and making his famous sea-charts. Perhaps it was in his studio that Christopher first saw a chart$ and first fell in love with the magic that can transfer the shapes of oceans and continents to a piece of paper. Then he would be off again in another ship$ to the Golden Horn perhaps$ or the Black Sea$ for the Genoese had a great Crimean trade. This is all conjecture$ but very reasonable conjecture; what we know for a fact is that he saw the white gum drawn from the lentiscus shrubs in Chio at the time of their flowering; that fragrant memory is preserved long afterwards in his own writings$ evoked by some incident in the newly-discovered islands of the West. There are vague rumours and stories of his having been engaged in various expeditionsamong them one fitted out in Genoa by John of Anjou to recover the kingdom of Naples for King Rene of Provence; but there is no reason to believe these rumours: good reason to disbelieve them$ rather.
Arabia,Arabia,47.4490397,19.4914108,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Cubagua,Cubagua$ Nueva Esparta$ Venezuela,-64.1892319,10.8201196,On August 11th Columbus turned east again after having given up the attempt to find a passage to the north round Paria. There were practical considerations that brought him to this action. As the water was growing shoaler and shoaler he had sent a caravel of light draft some way further to the westward$ and she reported that there lay ahead of her a great inner bay or gulf consisting of almost entirely fresh water. Provisions$ moreover$ were running short$ and were$ as usual$ turning bad; the Admirals health made vigorous action of any kind impossible for him; he was anxious about the condition of Espanolaanxious also$ as we have seen$ to send this great news home; and he therefore turned back and decided to risk the passage of the Dragons Mouth. He anchored in the neighbouring harbour until the wind was in the right quarter$ and with some trepidation put his ships into the boiling tideway. When they were in the middle of the passage the wind fell to a dead calm$ and the ships$ with their sails hanging loose$ were borne on the dizzy surface of eddies$ overfalls$ and whirls of the tide. Fortunately there was deep water in the passage$ and the strength of the current carried them safely through. Once outside they bore away to the northward$ sighting the islands of Tobago and Grenada and$ turning westward again$ came to the islands of Cubagua and Margarita$ where three pounds of pearls were bartered from the natives. A week after the passage of the Dragons Mouth Columbus sighted the south coast of Espanola$ which coast he made at a point a long way to the east of the new settlement that he had instructed Bartholomew to found; and as the winds were contrary$ and he feared it might take him a long time to beat up against them$ he sent a boat ashore with a letter which was to be delivered by a native messenger to the Adelantado. The letter was delivered; a few days later a caravel was sighted which contained Bartholomew himself; and once more$ after a long separation$ these two friends and brothers were united.

He turned northward$ sailed through the strait of Belle Isle$ and came home again$ having accomplished his task in three months. Cabot$ like Columbus$ believed he had seen the territory of the Great Khan$ of whom he told the interested population of Bristol some strange things. He further told them of the probable riches of this new land if it were followed in a southerly direction; told them some lies also$ it appears$ since he said that the waters there were so dense with fish that his vessels could hardly move in them. He received a gratuity of L10 and a pension$ and made a great sensation in Bristol by walking about the city dressed in fine silk garments. He took other voyages also with his son Sebastian$ who followed with him the rapid widening stream of discovery and became Pilot Major of Spain$ and President of the Congress appointed in 1524 to settle the conflicting pretensions of various discoverers; but so far as our narrative is concerned$ having sailed across from Bristol and discovered the mainland of the New World some years before Columbus discovered it$ John Cabot sails into oblivion.
Deum,71-26 Roosevelt Ave$ Jackson Heights$ NY 11372$ USA,-73.8939721,40.7464602,The Sovereigns were delighted and profoundly impressed. Columbus wound up his address with an eloquent peroration concerning the glory to Christendom of these new discoveries; and there followed an impressive silence$ during which the Sovereigns sank on their knees and raised hands and tearful eyes to heaven$ an example in which they were followed by the whole of the assembly; and an appropriate gesture enough$ seeing what was to come of it all. The choir of the Chapel Royal sang a solemn Te Deum on the spot; and the Sovereigns and nobles$ bishops$ archbishops$ grandees$ hidalgos$ chamberlains$ treasurers$ chancellors and other courtiers$ being exhausted by these emotions$ retired to dinner.
Christendom,Front Royal $ United States,-78.146138,38.949664,A memorandum for you$ my very dear son$ Don Diego$ of what occurs to me at the present time which must be done:The principal thing is$ affectionately and with great devotion to commend the soul of the Queen$ our Lady$ to God. Her life was always Catholic and Holy and ready for all the things of His holy service$ and for this reason it must be believed that she is in His holy glory and beyond the desires of this rough and wearisome world. Then the next thing is to be watchful and exert ones self in the service of the King$ our Lord$ and to strive to keep him from being troubled. His Highness is the head of Christendom. See the proverb which says that when the head aches$ all the members ache. So that all good Christians should entreat that he may have long life and health: and those of us who are obliged to serve him more than others must join in this supplication with great earnestness and diligence. This reason prompts me now with my severe illness to write you what I am writing here$ that his Highness may dispose matters for his service: and for the better fulfilment I am sending your brother there$ who$ although he is a child in days$ is not a child in understanding; and I am sending your uncle and Carbajal$ so that if this$ my writing$ is not sufficient$ they$ together with yourself$ can furnish verbal evidence. In my opinion there is nothing so necessary for the service of his Highness as the disposition and remedying of the affair of the Indies.
Anacaona,Santo Domingo $ Dominican Republic,-69.9843863,18.4705011,Of pretty Higuamota$ who once lived like a dryad among the groves of Espanola and has been dead now for so long$ we know nothing except that she was beautiful$ which$ although she doubtless did not think so while she lived$ turns out to have been the most important thing about her. Young Guevara$ coming to stay with his cousin Adrian$ becomes a visitor at the house of Anacaona; sees the pretty daughter and falls in love with her. Other people also$ it appears$ have been in a similar state$ but Higuamota is not very accessible; a fact which of course adds to the interest of the chase$ and turns dissolute Fernandos idle preference into something like a passion. Roldan$ who has also had an eye upon her$ and apparently no more than an eye$ discovers that Fernando$ in order to gratify his passion$ is proposing to go the absurd length of marrying the young woman$ and has sent for a priest for that purpose. Roldan$ instigated thereto by primitive forces$ thinks it would be impolitic for a Spanish grandee to marry with a heathen; very well$ then$ Fernando will have her baptizednothing simpler when water and a priest are handy. Roldan$ seeing that the young man is serious$ becomes peremptory$ and orders him to leave Xaragua. Fernando ostentatiously departs$ but is discovered a little later actually living in the house of Anacaona$ who apparently is sympathetic to Loves young dream. Once more ordered away$ this time with anger and threats$ Guevara changes his tune and implores Roldan to let him stay$ promising that he will give up the marriage project and also$ no doubt$ the no-marriage project. But Guevara has sympathisers. The mutineers have not forgiven Roldan for deserting them and becoming a lawful instead of an unlawful ruler. They are all on the side of Guevara$ who accordingly moves to the next stage of island procedure$ and sets on foot some kind of plot to kill Roldan and the Admiral. Fortunately where there is treachery it generally works both ways; this plot came to the ears of the authorities; the conspirators were arrested and sent to San Domingo.
Palencia,St. Augustine $ United States,-81.38562569999999,30.0261591,VERY DEAR SON$I wrote you at length by the courier who will arrive there to-day$ and sent you a letter for the Lord Chamberlain. I intended to inclose in it a copy of that chapter of the letter from their Highnesses in which they say they will order you placed in possession; but I forgot to do it here. Zamora$ the courier$ came. I read your letter and also those of your uncle and brother and Carbajal$ and felt great pleasure in learning that they had arrived well$ as I had been very anxious about them. Diego Mendez will leave here in three or four days with the order of payment prepared. He will take a long statement of everything and I will write to Juan Velasquez. I desire his friendship and service. I believe that he is a very honourable gentleman. If the Lord Bishop of Palencia has come$ or comes$ tell him how much pleased I have been with his prosperity$ and that if I go there I must stop with his Worship even if he does not wish it$ and that we must return to our first fraternal love. And that he could not refuse it because my service will force him to have it thus. I said that the letter for the Holy Father was sent that his Worship might see it if he was there$ and also the Lord Archbishop of Seville$ as the King might not have opportunity to read it. I have already told you that the petition to their Highnesses must be for the fulfilment of what they wrote me about the possession and of the rest which was promised me. I said that this chapter of the letter must be shown them and said that it must not be delayed$ and that this is advisable for an infinite number of reasons. His Highness may believe that$ however much he gives me$ the increase of his exalted dominions and revenue will be in the proportion of 100 to 1$ and that there is no comparison between what has been done and what is to be done. The sending of a Bishop to Espanola must be delayed until I speak to his Highness. It must not be as in the other cases when it was thought to mend matters and they were spoiled. There have been some cold days here and they have caused me great fatigue and fatigue me now. Commend me to the favour of the Lord Adelantado. May our Lord guard and bless you and your brother. Give my regards to Carbajal and Jeronimo. Diego Mendez will carry a full pouch there. I believe that the affair of which you wrote can be very easily managed. The vessels from the Indies have not arrived from Lisbon. They brought a great deal of gold$ and none for me. So great a mockery was never seen$ for I left there 60$000 pesos smelted. His Highness should not allow so great an affair to be ruined$ as is now taking place. He now sends to the Governor a new provision. I do not know what it is about. I expect letters each day. Be very careful about expenditures$ for it is necessary.
Guinea,Guinea,-9.696645,9.945587,They brought some women and boys with them$ and the fleet must now have had a large number of these willing or unwilling captives. This was the first organised transaction of slavery on the part of Columbus$ whose design was to send slaves regularly back to Spain in exchange for the cattle and supplies necessary for the colonies. There was not very much said now about religious conversion$ but only about exchanging the natives for cattle. The fine point of Christophers philosophy on this subject had been rubbed off; he had taken the first step a year ago on the beach at Guanahani$ and after that the road opened out broad before him. Slaves for cattle$ and cattle for the islands; and wealth from cattle and islands for Spain$ and payment from Spain for Columbus$ and money from Columbus for the redemption of the Holy Sepulchrethese were the links in the chain of hope that bound him to his pious idea. He had seen the same thing done by the Portuguese on the Guinea coast$ and it never occurred to him that there was anything the matter with it. On the contrary$ at this time his idea was only to take slaves from among the Caribs and man-eating islanders as a punishment for their misdeeds; but this$ like his other fine ideas$ soon had to give way before the tide of greed and conquest.
St.,São Tomé and Príncipe,6.613080999999999,0.18636,VERY DEAR SON$I received your letter by the courier. You did well in remaining yonder to remedy our affairs somewhat and to employ yourself now in our business. Ever since I came to Castile$ the Lord Bishop of Palencia has shown me favour and has desired that I should be honoured. Now he must be entreated that it may please him to occupy himself in remedying my many grievances and in ordering that the agreement and letters of concession which their Highnesses gave me be fulfilled$ and that I be indemnified for so many damages. And he may be certain that if their Highnesses do this$ their estate and greatness will be multiplied to them in an incredible degree. And it must not appear to him that forty thousand pesos in gold is more than a representation of it; because they might have had a much greater quantity if Satan had not hindered it by impeding my design; for$ when I was taken away from the Indies$ I was prepared to give them a sum of gold incomparable to forty thousand pesos. I make oath$ and this may be for thee alone$ that the damage to me in the matter of the concessions their Highnesses have made to me$ amounts to ten millions each year$ and never can be made good. You see what will be$ or is$ the injury to their Highnesses in what belongs to them$ and they do not perceive it. I write at their disposal and will strive to start yonder. My arrival and the rest is in the hands of our Lord. His mercy is infinite. What is done and is to be done$ St. Augustine says is already done before the creation of the world. I write also to these other Lords named in the letter of Diego Mendez. Commend me to their mercy and tell them of my going as I have said above. For certainly I feel great fear$ as the cold is so inimical to this$ my infirmity$ that I may have to remain on the road.
Bahamas,The Bahamas,-77.39627999999999,25.03428,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Los,Columbus $ United States,-94.84222,37.1704812,While he was waiting for their summons at Los Palacios$ a small town near Seville$ he was the guest of the curate of that place$ Andrez Bernaldez$ who had been chaplain to Christophers old friend DEA$ the Archbishop of Seville. This good priest evidently proved a staunch friend to Columbus at this anxious period of his life$ for the Admiral left many important papers in his charge when he again left Spain$ and no small part of the scant contemporary information about Columbus that has come down to us is contained in the Historia de los Reyes Catolicos$ which Bernaldez wrote after the death of Columbus.
Cardinal,Irvine $ United States,-117.7219155,33.6990751,At the house of Alonso de Quintanilla$ however$ Columbus was not altogether wasting his time. He met there some of the great persons of the Court$ among them the celebrated Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza$ Archbishop of Toledo and Grand Cardinal of Spain. This was far too great a man to be at this time anything like a friend of Columbus; but Columbus had been presented to him; the Cardinal would know his name$ and what his business was; and that is always a step towards consideration. Cabrero$ the royal Chamberlain$ was also often a fellow-guest at the Treasurers table; and with him Columbus contracted something like a friendship. Every one who met him liked him; his dignity$ his simplicity of thought and manner$ his experience of the sea$ and his calm certainty and conviction about the stupendous thing which he proposed to do$ could not fail to attract the liking and admiration of those with whom he came in contact. In the meantime a committee appointed by the Queen sat upon his proposals. The committee met under the presidentship of Hernando de Talavera$ the prior of the monastery of Santa Maria del Prado$ near Valladolid$ a pious ecclesiastic$ who had the rare quality of honesty$ and who was therefore a favourite with Queen Isabella; she afterwards created him Archbishop of Granada. He was not$ however$ poor honest soul! quite the man to grasp and grapple with this wild scheme for a voyage across the ocean. Once more Columbus$ as in Portugal$ set forth his views with eloquence and conviction; and once more$ at the tribunal of learning$ his unlearned proposals were examined and condemned. Not only was Columbuss Idea regarded as scientifically impossible$ but it was also held to come perilously near to heresy$ in its assumption of a state of affairs that was clearly at variance with the writings of the Fathers and the sacred Scriptures themselves.
Gibraltar,Gibraltar,-5.353585,36.140751,It is another illustration of the way in which discovery and imagination had hitherto gone by steps and not by flights$ that geographical knowledge reached the islands of the Atlantic (none of which were at a very great distance from the coast of Europe or from each other) at a comparatively early date$ and stopped there until in Columbus there was found a man with faith strong enough to make the long flight beyond them to the unknown West. And yet the philosophers$ and later the cartographers$ true to their instinct for this pedestrian kind of imagination$ put mythical lands and islands to the westward of the known islands as though they were really trying to make a way$ to sink stepping stones into the deep sea that would lead their thoughts across the unknown space. In the Catalan map of the world$ which was the standard example of cosmography in the early days of Columbus$ most of these mythical islands are marked. There was the island of Antilia$ which was placed in 25 deg. 35 W.$ and was said to have been discovered by Don Roderick$ the last of the Gothic kings of Spain$ who fled there after his defeat by the Moors. There was the island of the Seven Cities$ which is sometimes identified with this Antilia$ and was the object of a persistent belief or superstition on the part of the inhabitants of the Canary Islands. They saw$ or thought they saw$ about ninety leagues to the westward$ an island with high peaks and deep valleys. The vision was intermittent; it was only seen in very clear weather$ on some of those pure$ serene days of the tropics when in the clear atmosphere distant objects appear to be close at hand. In cloudy$ and often in clear weather also$ it was not to be seen at all; but the inhabitants of the Canaries$ who always saw it in the same place$ were so convinced of its reality that they petitioned the King of Portugal to allow them to go and take possession of it; and several expeditions were in fact despatched$ but none ever came up with that fairy land. It was called the island of the Seven Cities from a legend of seven bishops who had fled from Spain at the time of the Moorish conquest$ and$ landing upon this island$ had founded there seven splendid cities. There was the island of St. Brandan$ called after the Saint who set out from Ireland in the sixth century in search of an island which always receded before his ships; this island was placed several hundred miles to the west of the Canaries on maps and charts through out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was the island of Brazil$ to the west of Cape St. Vincent; the islands of Royllo$ San Giorgio$ and Isola di Mam; but they were all islands of dreams$ seen by the eyes of many mariners in that imaginative time$ but never trodden by any foot of man. To Columbus$ however$ and the mariners of his day$ they were all real places$ which a man might reach by special good fortune or heroism$ but which$ all things considered$ it was not quite worth the while of any man to attempt to reach. They have all disappeared from our charts$ like the Atlantis of Plato$ that was once charted to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar$ and of which the Canaries were believed to be the last peaks unsubmerged.
Ireland,Ireland,-7.692053599999999,53.1423672, p127.jpg (55K) The Palos that witnessed the fitting out of the ships of Columbus exists no longer. The soul is gone from it; the trade that in those days made it great and busy has floated away from it into other channels; and it has dwindled and shrunk$ until to-day it consists of nothing but a double street of poor white houses$ such almost as you may see in any sea-coast village in Ireland. The slow salt tides of the Atlantic come flooding in over the Manto bank$ across the bar of Saltes$ and$ dividing at the tongue of land that separates the two rivers$ creep up the mud banks of the Tinto and the Odiel until they lie deep beside the wharves of Huelva and Palos; but although Huelva still has a trade the tides bring nothing to Palos$ and take nothing away with them again. From La Rabida now you can no longer see$ as Columbus saw$ fleets of caravels lying-to and standing off and on outside the bar waiting for the flood tide; only a few poor boats fishing for tunny in the empty sunny waters$ or the smoke of a steamer standing on her course for the Guadalquiver or Cadiz.
Segovia,Segovia $ Spain,-4.108806899999999,40.9429032,From Segovia Columbus followed the Court to Salamanca and thence to Valladolid$ where his increasing illness kept him a prisoner after the Court had left to greet Philip and Juana. He had been in attendance upon it for nearly a year$ and without any results: and now$ as his infirmity increased$ he turned to the settling of his own affairs$ and drawing up of wills and codicilsall very elaborate and precise. In these occupations his worldly affairs were duly rounded off; and on May 19$ 1506$ having finally ratified a will which he had made in Segovia a year before$ in which the descent of his honours was entailed upon Diego and his heirs$ or failing him Ferdinand and his heirs$ or failing him Bartholomew and his heirs$ he turned to the settlement of his soul.
Italy,Italy,12.56738,41.87194,The Admiral$ however$ was not to be so lonely a person as he had been on his first voyage; friends of his own choice and of a rank that made intimacy possible even with the Captain-General were to accompany him. There was James his brother; there was Friar Bernardo Buil$ a Benedictine monk chosen by the Pope to be his apostolic vicar in the New World; there was Alonso de Ojeda$ a handsome young aristocrat$ cousin to the Inquisitor of Spain$ who was distinguished for his dash and strength and pluck; an ideal adventurer$ the idol of his fellows$ and one of whose daring any number of credible and incredible tales were told. There was Pedro Margarite$ a well-born Aragonese$ who was destined afterwards to cause much trouble; there was Juan Ponce de Leon$ the discoverer of Florida; there was Juan de La Cosa$ Columbuss faithful pilot on the Santa Maria on his first voyage; there was Pedro de Las Casas$ whose son$ at this time a student in Seville$ was afterwards to become the historian of the New World and the champion of decency and humanity there. There was also Doctor Chanca$ a Court physician who accompanied the expedition not only in his professional capacity but also because his knowledge of botany would enable him to make$ a valuable report on the vegetables and fruits of the New World; there was Antonio de Marchena$ one of Columbuss oldest friends$ who went as astronomer to the expedition. And there was one Coma$ who would have remained unknown to this day but that he wrote an exceedingly elegant letter to his friend Nicolo Syllacio in Italy$ describing in flowery language the events of the second voyage; which letter$ and one written by Doctor Chanca$ are the only records of the outward voyage that exist. The journal kept by Columbus on this voyage has been lost$ and no copy of it remains.
York,York $ United Kingdom,-1.0872979,53.95996510000001,But in the meanwhile the Chapter of the cathedral in San Domingo had made new discoveries and examinations; had found another box of bones$ which bore to them authentic signs that the dust it contained was the Admirals and not his grandsons; and in spite of the Academy of History at Madrid$ it is indeed far from unlikely that the Admirals dust does not lie in Spain or Cuba$ but in San Domingo still. Whole books have been written about these boxes of bones; learned societies have argued about them$ experts have examined the bones and the boxes with microscopes; and meantime the dust of Columbus$ if we take the view that an error was committed in the transference to Cuba$ is not even collected all in one box. A sacrilegious official acquired some of it when the boxes were opened$ and distributed it among various curiosity-hunters$ who have preserved it in caskets of crystal and silver. Thus a bit of him is worn by an American lady in a crystal locket; a pinch of him lies in a glass vial in a New York mansion; other pinches in the Lennox Library$ New York$ in the Vatican$ and in the University of Pavia. In such places$ if the Admiral should fail to appear at the first note of their trumpets$ must the Angels of the Resurrection make search.
Europe,Europe,15.2551187,54.5259614,After that there was never any more resistance; it was simply a case of extermination$ which the Spaniards easily accomplished by cutting of the heads of women as they passed by$ and impaling infants and little children on their lances as they rode through the villages. Thus$ in the twelve years since the discovery of Columbus$ between half a million and a million natives$ perished; and as the Spanish colonisation spread afterwards from island to island$ and the banner of civilisation and Christianity was borne farther abroad throughout the Indies$ the same hideous process was continued. In Cuba$ in Jamaica$ throughout the Antilles$ the cross and the sword$ the whip-lash and the Gospel advanced together; wherever the Host was consecrated$ hideous cries of agony and suffering broke forth; until happily$ in the fulness of time$ the dire business was complete$ and the whole of the people who had inhabited this garden of the world were exterminated and their blood and race wiped from the face of the earth . . . . Unless$ indeed$ blood and race and hatred be imperishable things; unless the faithful Earth that bred and reared the race still keeps in her soil$ and in the waving branches of the trees and the green grasses$ the sacred essences of its blood and hatred; unless in the full cycle of Time$ when that suffering flesh and blood shall have gone through all the changes of substance and condition$ from corruption and dust through flowers and grasses and trees and animals back into the living body of mankind again$ it shall one day rise up terribly to avenge that horror of the past. Unless Earth and Time remember$ O Children of the Sun! for men have forgotten$ and on the soil of your Paradise the African negro$ learned in the vices of Europe$ erects his monstrous effigy of civilisation and his grotesque mockery of freedom; unless it be through his brutish body$ into which the blood and hatred with which the soil of Espanola was soaked have now passed$ that they shall dreadfully strike at the world again.
Columbus,Columbus $ United States,-82.99879419999999,39.9611755,A face that will not look upon you can never give up its secret to you; and the face of the sea is like the face of a picture or a statue round which you may circle$ looking at it from this point and from that$ but whose regard is fixed on something beyond and invisible to you; or it is like the face of a person well known to you in life$ a face which you often see in various surroundings$ from different angles$ now unconscious$ now in animated and smiling intercourse with some one else$ but which never turns upon you the light of friendly knowledge and recognition; in a word$ it is unconscious of you$ like all elemental things. In the legend of the Creation it is written that when God saw the gathering together of the waters which he called the Seas$ he saw that it was good; and he perhaps had the right to say so. But the man who uses the sea and whose lifes pathway is laid on its unstable surface can hardly sum up his impressions of it so simply as to say that it is good. It is indeed to him neither good nor bad; it is utterly beyond and outside all he knows or invents of good and bad$ and can never have any concern with his good or his bad. It remains the pathway and territory of powers and mysteries$ thoughts and energies on a gigantic and elemental scale; and that is why the mind of man can never grapple with the unconsciousness of the sea or his eye meet its eye. Yet it is the mariners chief associate$ whether as adversary or as ally; his attitude to things outside himself is beyond all doubt influenced by his attitude towards it; and a true comprehension of the man Columbus must include a recognition of this constant influence on him$ and of whatever effect lifelong association with so profound and mysterious an element may have had on his conduct in the world of men. Better than many documents as an aid to our understanding of him would be intimate association with the sea$ and prolonged contemplation of that face with which he was so familiar. We can never know the heart of it$ but we can at least look upon the face$ turned from us though it is$ upon which he looked. Cloud shadows following a shimmer of sunlit ripples; lines and runes traced on the surface of a blank calm; salt laughter of purple furrows with the foam whipping off them; tides and eddies$ whirls$ overfalls$ ripples$ breakers$ seas mountains high-they are but movements and changing expressions on an eternal countenance that once held his gaze and wonder$ as it will always hold the gaze and wonder of those who follow the sea.
Lajes,Lajes$ Praia da Vitória $ Portugal,-27.0869431,38.75388,Three vessels were at last secured. The first$ named the Santa Maria$ was the largest$ and was chosen to be the flagship of Columbus. She was of about one hundred tons burden$ and would be about ninety feet in length by twenty feet beam. She was decked over$ and had a high poop astern and a high forecastle in the bows. She had three masts$ two of them square-rigged$ with a latine sail on the mizzen mast; and she carried a crew of fifty-two persons. Where and how they all stowed themselves away is a matter upon which we can only make wondering guesses; for this ship was about the size of an ordinary small coasting schooner$ such as is worked about the coasts of these islands with a crew of six or eight men. The next largest ship was the Pinta$ which was commanded by Martin Alonso Pinzon$ who took his brother Francisco with him as sailing-master. The Pinta was of fifty tons burden$ decked only at the bow and stern$ and the fastest of the three ships; she also had three masts. The third ship was a caravel of forty tons and called the Nina; she belonged to Juan Nino of Palos. She was commanded by Vincenti Pinzon$ and had a complement of eighteen men. Among the crew of the flagship$ whose names and places of residence are to be found in the Appendix$ were an Englishman and an Irishman. The Englishman is entered as Tallarte de Lajes (Ingles)$ who has been ingeniously identified with a possible Allard or AEthelwald of Winchelsea$ there having been several generations of Allards who were sailors of Winchelsea in the fifteenth century. Sir Clements Markham thinks that this Allard may have been trading to Coruna and have married and settled down at Lajes. There is also Guillermo Ires$ an Irishman from Galway.
Fe,Province of Ferrara$ Italy,11.7644068,44.76636800000001,After the wedding of Prince Juan in March 1497$ when Queen Isabella had more time to give to external affairs$ the promise to Columbus was again remembered$ and his position was considered in detail. An order was made (April 23rd$ 1497)$ restoring to the Admiral the original privileges bestowed upon him at Santa Fe. He was offered a large tract of land in Espanola$ with the title of Duke; but much as he hankered after titular honours$ he was for once prudent enough to refuse this gift. His reason was that it would only further damage his influence$ and give apparent justification to those enemies who said that the whole enterprise had been undertaken merely in his own interests; and it is possible also that his many painful associations with Espanola$ and the bloodshed and horrors that he had witnessed there$ had aroused in his superstitious mind a distaste for possessions and titles in that devastated Paradise. Instead$ he accepted a measure of relief from the obligations incurred by his eighth share in the many unprofitable expeditions that had been sent out during the last three years$ agreeing for the next three years to receive an eighth share of the gross income$ and a tenth of the net profits$ without contributing anything to the cost. His appointment of Bartholomew to the office of Adelantado$ which had annoyed Ferdinand$ was now confirmed; the universal license which had been granted to Spanish subjects to settle in the new lands was revoked in so far as it infringed the Admirals privileges; and he was granted a force of 330 officers$ soldiers$ and artificers to be at his personal disposal in the prosecution of his next voyage.
Cipango,藤沢市 $ Japan,139.486402,35.338089,If the other islands had seemed beautiful to him$ Cuba seemed like heaven itself. The mountains grandly rising in the interior$ the noble rivers and long sweeping plains$ the headlands melting into the clear water$ and the gorgeous colours and flowers and birds and insects on land acted like a charm on Columbus and his sailors. As they entered the river they lowered a boat in order to go ahead and sound for an anchorage; and two native canoes put off from the shore$ but$ when they saw the boat approaching$ fled again. The Admiral landed and found two empty houses containing nets and hooks and fishing-lines$ and one of the strange silent dogs$ such as they had encountered on the other islanddogs that pricked their ears and wagged their tails$ but that never barked. The Admiral$ in spite of his greed for gold and his anxiety to free the people of the island$ was now acting much more discreetly$ and with the genuine good sense which he always possessed and which was only sometimes obscured. He would not allow anything in the empty houses to be disturbed or taken away$ and whenever he saw the natives he tried to show them that he intended to do them no harm$ and to win their good will by making them presents of beads and toys for which he would take no return. As he went on up the river the scenery became more and more enchanting$ so that he felt quite unhappy at not being able to express all the wonders and beauties that he saw. In the pure air and under the serene blue of the sky those matchless hues of blossom and foliage threw a rainbow-coloured garment on either bank of the river; the flamingoes$ the parrots and woodpeckers and humming-birds calling to one another and flying among the tree-tops$ made the upper air also seem alive and shot with all the colours of the rainbow. Humble Christopher$ walking amid these gorgeous scenes$ awed and solemnised by the strangeness and magnificence of nature around him$ tries to identify something that he knows; and thinks$ that amid all these strange chorusings of unknown birds$ he hears the familiar note of a nightingale. Amid all his raptures$ however$ the main chance is not forgotten; everything that he sees he translates into some terms of practical utility. Just as on the voyage out every seaweed or fish or flying bird that he saw was hailed by him as a sign that land was near$ so amid the beauty of this virgin world everything that he sees is taken to indicate either that he is close upon the track of the gold$ or that he must be in Cipango$ or that the natives will be easy to convert to Christianity. In the fragrance of the woods of Cuba$ Columbus thought that he smelled Oriental spices$ which Marco Polo had described as abounding in Cipango; when he walked by the shore and saw the shells of pearl oysters$ he believed the island to be loaded with pearls and precious stones; when he saw a scrap of tinsel or bright metal adorning a native$ he argued that there was a gold mine close at hand. And so he went on in an increasing whirl of bewildering enchantment from anchorage to anchorage and from island to island$ always being led on by that yellow will o-the-wisp$ gold$ and always believing that the wealth of the Orient would be his on the morrow. As he coasted along towards the west he entered the river which he called Rio de Mares. He found a large village here full of palm-branch houses furnished with chairs and hammocks and adorned with wooden masks and statues; but in spite of his gentleness and offer of gifts the inhabitants all fled to the mountains$ while he and his men walked curiously through the deserted houses.
Provence,Provence$ France,6.2116438,44.0144936,In this faith$ then$ and with this equipment$ and about the year 1465$ Christopher Columbus began his sea travels. His voyages would be doubtless at first much along the coasts$ and across to Alexandria and the Islands. There would be returnings to Genoa$ and glad welcomings by the little household in the narrow street; in 1472 and 1473 he was with his father at Savona$ helping with the wool-weaving and tavern-keeping; possibly also there were interviews with Benincasa$ who was at that time living in Genoa$ and making his famous sea-charts. Perhaps it was in his studio that Christopher first saw a chart$ and first fell in love with the magic that can transfer the shapes of oceans and continents to a piece of paper. Then he would be off again in another ship$ to the Golden Horn perhaps$ or the Black Sea$ for the Genoese had a great Crimean trade. This is all conjecture$ but very reasonable conjecture; what we know for a fact is that he saw the white gum drawn from the lentiscus shrubs in Chio at the time of their flowering; that fragrant memory is preserved long afterwards in his own writings$ evoked by some incident in the newly-discovered islands of the West. There are vague rumours and stories of his having been engaged in various expeditionsamong them one fitted out in Genoa by John of Anjou to recover the kingdom of Naples for King Rene of Provence; but there is no reason to believe these rumours: good reason to disbelieve them$ rather.
Villegio,Clifton $ United States,-77.38670800000001,38.7806606,Columbus was not far wrong in his estimate of the effect likely to be produced by his manacles$ and when the ships of Villegio arrived at Cadiz in October$ the spectacle of an Admiral in chains produced a degree of commiseration which must have exceeded his highest hopes. He was now in his fiftieth year and of an extremely venerable appearance$ his kindling eye looking forth from under brows of white$ his hair and beard snow-white$ his face lined and spiritualised with suffering and sorrow. It must be remembered that before the Spanish people he had always appeared in more or less state. They had not that intimacy with him$ an intimacy which perhaps brought contempt$ which the people in Espanola enjoyed; and in Spain$ therefore$ the contrast between his former grandeur and this condition of shame and degradation was the more striking. It was a fact that the people of Spain could not neglect. It touched their sense of the dramatic and picturesque$ touched their hearts also perhapshearts quick to burn$ quick to forget. They had forgotten him before$ now they burned with indignation at the picture of this venerable and much-suffering man arriving in disgrace.
Galway,Galway $ Ireland,-9.0567905,53.270668,Allard and William$ shuffling into the recruiting office in Palos$ doubtless think that this is a strange place for them to meet$ and rather a wild business that they are embarked upon$ among all these bloody Spaniards. Some how I feel more confidence in Allard than in William$ knowing$ as I do so well$ this William of Galway$ whether on his native heath or in the strange and distant parts of the world to which his sanguine temperament leads him. Alas$ William$ you are but the first of a mighty stream that will leave the Old Country for the New World; the world destined to be good for the fortunes of many from the Old Country$ but for the Old Country itself not good. Little does he know$ drunken William$ willing to be on hand where there is adventure brewing$ and to be after going with the boys and getting his health on the salt water$ what a path of hope for those who go$ and of heaviness for those who stay behind$ he is opening up . . . . Farewell$ William; I hope you were not one of those whom they let out of gaol.
Malaga,Málaga$ Spain,-4.4213988,36.7212737,In the meantime he was to have a change of scene. Isabella followed Ferdinand to the siege of Malaga$ where the Court was established; and as there were intervals in which other than military business might be transacted$ Columbus was ordered to follow them in case his affairs should come up for consideration. They did not; but the man himself had an experience that may have helped to keep his thoughts from brooding too much on his unfulfilled ambition. Years afterwards$ when far away on lonely seas$ amid the squalor of a little ship and the staggering buffets of a gale$ there would surely sometimes leap into his memory a brightly coloured picture of this scene in the fertile valley of Malaga: the silken pavilions of the Court$ the great encampment of nobility with its arms and banners extending in a semicircle to the seashore$ all glistening and moving in the bright sunshine. There was added excitement at this time at an attempt to assassinate Ferdinand and Isabella$ a fanatic Moor having crept up to one of the pavilions and aimed a blow at two people whom he mistook for the King and Queen. They turned out to be Don Alvaro de Portugal$ who was dangerously wounded$ and Columbuss friend$ the Marquesa de Moya$ who was unhurt; but it was felt that the King and Queen had had a narrow escape. The siege was raised on the 18th of August$ and the sovereigns went to spend the winter at Zaragoza; and Columbus$ once more condemned to wait$ went back to Cordova.
Espaniola,Darmstadt $ Germany,8.6439868,49.87816489999999,They stayed two days in the harbour of Saint Nicholas$ and then began to coast eastwards along the shores of Espaniola. Their best progress was made at dawn and sunset$ when the land breeze blew off the island; and during the day they encountered a good deal of colder weather and easterly winds$ which made their progress slow. Every day they put in at one or other of the natural harbours in which that beautiful coast abounds; every day they saw natives on the shores who generally fled at their approach$ but were often prevailed upon to return and to converse with the natives on board the Admirals ship$ and to receive presents and bring parrots and bits of gold in exchange. On one day a party of men foraging ashore saw a beautiful young girl$ who fled at their approach; and they chased her a long way through the woods$ finally capturing her and bringing her on board. Columbus caused her to be clotheddoubtless a diverting occupation for Rodrigo$ Juan$ Garcia$ Pedro$ William$ and the rest of them$ although for the poor$ shy$ trembling captive not diverting at alland sent her ashore again loaded with beads and brass ringsto act as a decoy. Having sown this good seed the Admiral waited for a night$ and then sent a party of men ashore$ well prepared with arms and adapted for such an affair$ to have some conversation with the people. The innocent harvest was duly reaped; the natives met the Spaniards with gifts of food and drink$ and understanding that the Admiral would like to have a parrot$ they sent as many parrots as were wanted. The husband of the girl who had been captured and clothed came back with her to the shore with a large body of natives$ in order to thank the Admiral for his kindness and clemency; and their confidence was not misplaced$ as the Admiral did not at that moment wish to do any more kidnapping. The Spaniards were more and more amazed and impressed with the beauty and fertility of these islands. The lands were more lovely than the finest land in Castile; the rivers were large and wide$ the trees green and full of fruit$ the grasses knee-deep and starred with flowers; the birds sang sweetly all night; there were mastic trees and aloes and plantations of cotton. There was fishing in plenty; and if there were not any gold mines immediately at hand$ they here sure to be round the next headland or$ at the farthest$ in the next island. The people$ too$ charmed and delighted the Admiral$ who saw in them a future glorious army of souls converted to the Christian religion. They were taller and handsomer than the inhabitants of the other islands$ and the women much fairer; indeed$ if they had not been so much exposed to the sun$ and if they could only be clothed in the decent garments of civilisation$ the Admiral thought that their skins would be as white as those of the women of Spainwhich was only another argument for bringing them within the fold of the Holy Catholic Church. The men were powerful and apparently harmless; they showed no truculent or suspicious spirit; they had no knowledge of arms; a thousand of them would not face three Christians; and
Calicut,Kozhikode $ India,75.78041,11.2587531,The gate to the gold and pearls is now open$ and plenty of everythingprecious stones$ spices and a thousand other thingsmay be surely expected$ and never could a worse misfortune befall me: for by the name of our Lord the first voyage would yield them just as much as would the traffic of Arabia Felix as far as Mecca$ as I wrote to their Highnesses by Antonio de Tomes in my reply respecting the repartition of the sea and land with the Portuguese; and afterwards it would equal that of Calicut$ as I told them and put in writing at the monastery of the Mejorada.
Morocco,Morocco,-7.092619999999999,31.791702,Columbuss ships were on the point of sailing when word came that the Moors were besieging a Portuguese post on the coast of Morocco$ and$ as civility was now the order of the day between Spain and Portugal$ the Admiral was instructed to call on his way there and afford some relief. This he did$ sailing from Cadiz on the 9th or 10th of May to Ercilla on the Morocco coast$ where he anchored on the 13th. But the Moors had all departed and the siege was over; so Columbus$ having sent Bartholomew and some of his officers ashore on a civil visit$ which was duly returned$ set out the same day on his last voyage.
Flanders,Flanders$ Belgium,3.7264613,51.0108706, In the month of May the Admiral was well enough at last to undertake the journey to Segovia. He travelled on a mule$ and was accompanied by his brother Bartholomew and his son Ferdinand. When he reached the Court he found the King civil and outwardly attentive to his recitals$ but apparently content with a show of civility and outward attention. Columbus was becoming really a nuisance; that is the melancholy truth. The King had his own affairs to attend to; he was already meditating a second marriage$ and thinking of the young bride he was to bring home to the vacant place of Isabella; and the very iteration of Columbuss complaints and demands had made them lose all significance for the King. He waved them aside with polite and empty promises$ as people do the demands of importunate children; and finally$ to appease the Admiral and to get rid of the intolerable nuisance of his applications$ he referred the whole question$ first to Archbishop DEA$ and then to the body of councillors which had been appointed to interpret Queen Isabellas will. The whole question at issue was whether or not the original agreement with Columbus$ which had been made before his discoveries$ should be carried out. The King$ who had foolishly subscribed to it simply as a matter of form$ never believing that anything much could come of it$ was determined that it should not be carried out$ as it would give Columbus a wealth and power to which no mere subject of a crown was entitled. The Admiral held fast to his privileges; the only thing that he would consent to submit to arbitration was the question of his revenues; but his titles and territorial authorities he absolutely stuck to. Of course the council did exactly what the King had done. They talked about the thing a great deal$ but they did nothing. Columbus was an invalid and broken man$ who might die any day$ and it was obviously to their interest to gain time by discussion and delaya cruel game for our Christopher$ who knew his days on earth to be numbered$ and who struggled in that web of time in which mortals try to hurry the events of the present and delay the events of the future. Meanwhile Philip of Austria and his wife Juana$ Isabellas daughter$ had arrived from Flanders to assume the crown of Castile$ which Isabella had bequeathed to them. Columbus saw a chance for himself in this coming change$ and he sent Bartholomew as an envoy to greet the new Sovereigns$ and to enlist their services on the Admirals behalf. Bartholomew was very well received$ but he was too late to be of use to the Admiral$ whom he never saw again; and this is our farewell to Bartholomew$ who passes out of our narrative here. He went to Rome after Christophers death on a mission to the Pope concerning some fresh voyages of discovery; and in 1508 he made$ so far as we know$ his one excursion into romance$ when he assisted at the production of an illegitimate little girlhis only descendant. He returned to Espanola under the governorship of his nephew Diego$ and died there in 1514stern$ valiant$ brotherly soul$ whose devotion to Christopher must be for ever remembered and honoured with the name of the Admiral.
Ginestreto,Ginestreto $ Italy,12.8166163,43.8303462,Christopher is gone$ vanished over that blue horizon; and the tale of life in Genoa goes on without him very much as before$ except that Domenico has one apprentice less$ and$ a matter becoming of some importance in the narrow condition of his finances$ one boy less to feed and clothe. For good Domenico$ alas! is no economist. Those hardy adventures of his in the buying and selling line do not prosper him; the tavern does not pay; perhaps the tavern-keeper is too hospitable; at any rate$ things are not going well. And yet Domenico had a good start; as his brother Antonio has doubtless often told him$ he had the best of old Giovannis inheritance; he had the property at Quinto$ and other property at Ginestreto$ and some ground rents at Pradella; a tavern at Savona$ a shop there and at Genoareally$ Domenico has no excuse for his difficulties. In 1445 he was selling land at Quinto$ presumably with the consent of old Giovanni$ if he was still alive; and if he was not living$ then immediately after his death$ in the first pride of possession.
Vincent,Vincent $ United States,-117.921971,34.098915,Once more he exhibited his easy mastery of the art of navigation and his extraordinary gift for estimating dead-reckoning. After having been out of sight of land for eight weeks$ and while some of the sailors thought they might be in the Bay of Biscay$ and others that they were in the English Channel$ the Admiral suddenly announced that they were close to Cape Saint Vincent.
GENOA,Genoa $ Italy,8.946256,44.4056499,CHAPTER II. THE HOME IN GENOA
Savanna,Savannah $ United States,-81.09983419999999,32.0835407,The two forces met near the present town of Santiago$ in the plain known as the Savanna of Matanza. The Spanish force was divided into three main divisions$ under the command of Christopher and Bartholomew Columbus and Ojeda respectively. These three divisions attacked the Indians simultaneously from different points$ Ojeda throwing his cavalry upon them$ riding them down$ and cutting them to pieces. Drums were beaten and trumpets blown; the guns were fired from the cover of the trees; and a pack of bloodhounds$ which had been sent out from Spain with Bartholomew$ were let loose upon the natives and tore their bodies to pieces. It was an easy and horrible victory. The native force was estimated by Columbus at one hundred thousand men$ although we shall probably be nearer the mark if we reduce that estimate by one half.
Old,Bickerstaffe $ United Kingdom,-2.8524221,53.54575879999999,For in that fertile hotbed of imagination$ the Admirals brain$ a new and staggering theory had gradually been taking shape. As his ships had been wafted into this delicious region$ as the airs had become sweeter$ the vegetation more luxuriant$ and the water of the sea fresher$he had solemnly arrived at the conclusion that he was approaching the region of the true terrestrial Paradise: the Garden of Eden that some of the Fathers had declared to be situated in the extreme east of the Old World$ and in a region so high that the flood had not overwhelmed it. Columbus$ thinking hard in his cabin$ blood and brain a little fevered$ comes to the conclusion that the world is not round but pear-shaped. He knows that all this fresh water in the sea must come from a great distance and from no ordinary river; and he decides that its volume and direction have been acquired in its fall from the apex of the pear$ from the very top of the world$ from the Garden of Eden itself. It was a most beautiful conception; a theory worthy to be fitted to all the sweet sights and sounds in the world about him; but it led him farther and farther away from the truth$ and blinded him to knowledge and understanding of what he had actually accomplished.
Stream,Siloam Springs $ United States,-94.53027200000001,36.169936,Ovando once gone$ the Admiral could turn again to his own affairs. It is true there were rumours that the whole fleet had perished$ for it encountered a gale very soon after leaving Cadiz$ and a great quantity of the deck hamper was thrown overboard and was washed on the shores of Spain; and the Sovereigns were so bitterly distressed that$ as it is said$ they shut them selves up for eight days. News eventually came$ however$ that only one ship had been lost and that the rest had proceeded safely to San Domingo. Columbus$ much recovered in body and mind$ now began to apply for a fleet for himself. He had heard of the discovery by the Portuguese of the southern route to India; no doubt he had heard also much gossip of the results of the many private voyages of discovery that were sailing from Spain at this time; and he began to think seriously about his own discoveries and the way in which they might best be extended. He thought much of his voyage to the west of Trinidad and of the strange pent-up seas and currents that he had discovered there. He remembered the continual westward trend of the current$ and how all the islands in that sea had their greatest length east and west$ as though their shores had been worn into that shape by the constant flowing of the current; and it was not an unnatural conclusion for him to suppose that there was a channel far to the west through which these seas poured and which would lead him to the Golden Chersonesus. He put away from him that nightmare madness that he transacted on the coast of Cuba. He knew very well that he had not yet found the Golden Chersonesus and the road to India; but he became convinced that the western current would lead him there if only he followed it long enough. There was nothing insane about this theory; it was in fact a very well-observed and well-reasoned argument; and the fact that it happened to be entirely wrong is no reflection on the Admirals judgment. The great Atlantic currents at that time had not been studied; and how could he know that the western stream of water was the northern half of a great ocean current which sweeps through the Caribbean Sea$ into and round the Gulf of Mexico$ and flows out northward past Florida in the Gulf Stream?
Cayo,Cayo District$ Belize,-88.94138650000001,17.0984445,The Pinta was out of sight the next morning$ and the little Nina was all that the Admiral had to rely upon for convoy. They were now near the east end of the north coast of Cuba$ and they stood in to a harbour which the Admiral called Santa Catalina$ and which is now called Cayo de Moa. As the importance of the Nina to the expedition had been greatly increased by the defection of the Pinta$ Columbus went on board and examined her. He found that some of her spars were in danger of giving way; and as there was a forest of pine trees rising from the shore he was able to procure a new mizzen mast and latine yard in case it should be necessary to replace those of the Nina. The next morning he weighed anchor at sunrise and continued east along the coast. He had now arrived at the extreme end of Cuba$ and was puzzled as to what course he should take. Believing Cuba$ as he did$ to be the mainland of Cathay$ he would have liked to follow the coast in its trend to the south-west$ in the hope of coming upon the rich city of Quinsay; but on the other hand there was looming to the south-west some land which the natives with him assured him was Bohio$ the place where all the gold was. He therefore held on his course; but when the Indians found that he was really going to these islands they became very much alarmed$ and made signs that the people would eat them if they went there; and$ in order further to dissuade the Admiral$ they added that the people there had only one eye$ and the faces$ of dogs. As it did not suit Columbus to believe them he said that they were lying$ and that he felt that the island must belong to the domain of the Great Khan. He therefore continued his course$ seeing many beautiful and enchanting bays opening before him$ and longing to go into them$ but heroically stifling his curiosity$ because he was detained more than he desired by the pleasure and delight he felt in seeing and gazing on the beauty and freshness of those countries wherever he entered$ and because he did not wish to be delayed in prosecuting what he was engaged upon; and for these reasons he remained that night beating about and standing off and on until day. He could not trust himself$ that is to say$ to anchor in these beautiful harbours$ for he knew he would be tempted to go ashore and waste valuable time exploring the woods; and so he remained instead$ beating about in the open sea.
Sicily,Sicily$ Italy,14.0153557,37.5999938,They judge me over there as they would a governor who had gone to Sicily$ or to a city or town placed under regular government$ and where the laws can be observed in their entirety without fear of ruining everything; and I am greatly injured thereby.
Caonabo,Bocacanasta $ Dominican Republic,-70.3347946,18.2551447,It really began to seem as though Roldan$ having had his fling and secured the excessive privileges that he coveted$ had decided that loyalty to Christopher was for the present the most profitable policy; but the mutinous spirit that he had cultivated in his followers for his own ends could not be so readily converted into this cheap loyalty. More trouble was yet to come of this rebellion. There was in the island a young Spanish aristocrat$ Fernando de Guevara by name$ one of the many who had come out in the hope of enjoying himself and making a fortune quickly$ whose more than outrageously dissolute life in San Domingo had caused Columbus to banish him thence; and he was now living near Xaragua with a cousin of his$ Adrian de Moxeca$ who had been one of the ringleaders in Roldans conspiracy. Within this pleasant province of Xaragua lived$ as we have seen$ Anacaona$ the sister of Caonabo$ the Lord of the House of Gold. She herself was a beautiful woman$ called by her subjects Bloom of the Gold; and she had a still more beautiful daughter$ Higuamota$ who appears in history$ like so many other women$ on account of her charms and what came of them.
Persian,Iran,53.688046,32.427908,Columbus was never backward in fitting a story and a theory to whatever phenomena surrounded him; and in this case he was certain that the excavations were the work of Solomon$ and that he had discovered the gold of Ophir. Sure enough$ thinks the Admiral$ I have hit it this time; and the ships came eastward from the Persian Gulf round the Golden Chersonesus$ which I discovered this very last winter. Immediately$ as his habit was$ Columbus began to build castles in Spain. Here was a fine answer to Buil and Margarite! Without waiting a week or two to get any of the gold this extraordinary man decided to hurry off at once to Spain with the news$ not dreaming that Spain might$ by this time$ have had a surfeit of news$ and might be in serious need of some simple$ honest facts. But he thought his two caravels sufficiently freighted with this new beliefthe belief that he had discovered the Ophir of Solomon.
del,Delaware$ USA,-75.52766989999999,38.9108325,Thus passed the summer and autumn of 1487; precious months$ precious years slipping by$ and the great purpose as yet unfulfilled and seemingly no nearer to fulfilment. It is likely that Columbus kept up his applications to the Court$ and received polite and delaying replies. The next year came$ and the Court migrated from Zaragoza to Murcia$ from Murcia to Valladolid$ from Valladolid to Medina del Campo. Columbus attended it in one or other of these places$ but without result. In August Beatriz gave birth to a son$ who was christened Ferdinand$ and who lived to be a great comfort to his father$ if not to her also. But the miracle of paternity was not now so new and wonderful as it had been; the battle of life$ with its crosses and difficulties$ was thick about him; and perhaps he looked into this new-comers small face with conflicting thoughts$ and memories of the long white beach and the crashing surf at Porto Santo$ and regret for things lostso strangely mingled and inconsistent are the threads of human thought. At last he decided to turn his face elsewhere. In September 1488 he went to Lisbon$ for what purpose it is not certain; possibly in connection with the affairs of his dead wife; and probably also in the expectation of seeing his brother Bartholomew$ to whom we may now turn our attention for a moment.
Bethlehem,Bethlehem,35.2024425,31.7053821,After experiencing some terrible weather$ in the course of which they had been obliged to catch sharks for food and had once been nearly overwhelmed by a waterspout$ they entered a harbour where$ in the words of young Ferdinand$ we saw the people living like birds in the tops of the trees$ laying sticks across from bough to bough and building their huts upon them; and though we knew not the reason of the custom we guessed that it was done for fear of their enemies$ or of the griffins that are in this island. After further experiences of bad weather they made what looked like a suitable harbour on the coast of Veragua$ which harbour$ as they entered it on the day of the Epiphany (January 9$ 1503)$ they named Belem or Bethlehem. The river in the mouth of which they were anchored$ however$ was subject to sudden spouts and gushes of water from the hills$ one of which occurred on January 24th and nearly swamped the caravels. This spout of water was caused by the rainy season$ which had begun in the mountains and presently came down to the coast$ where it rained continuously until the 14th of February. They had made friends with the Quibian or chief of the country$ and he had offered to conduct them to the place where the gold mines were; so Bartholomew was sent off in the rain with a boat party to find this territory. It turned out afterwards that the cunning Quibian had taken them out of his own country and showed them the gold mined of a neighbouring chief$ which were not so rich as his own.
Madrid,Madrid $ Spain,-3.7037902,40.4167754,But in the meanwhile the Chapter of the cathedral in San Domingo had made new discoveries and examinations; had found another box of bones$ which bore to them authentic signs that the dust it contained was the Admirals and not his grandsons; and in spite of the Academy of History at Madrid$ it is indeed far from unlikely that the Admirals dust does not lie in Spain or Cuba$ but in San Domingo still. Whole books have been written about these boxes of bones; learned societies have argued about them$ experts have examined the bones and the boxes with microscopes; and meantime the dust of Columbus$ if we take the view that an error was committed in the transference to Cuba$ is not even collected all in one box. A sacrilegious official acquired some of it when the boxes were opened$ and distributed it among various curiosity-hunters$ who have preserved it in caskets of crystal and silver. Thus a bit of him is worn by an American lady in a crystal locket; a pinch of him lies in a glass vial in a New York mansion; other pinches in the Lennox Library$ New York$ in the Vatican$ and in the University of Pavia. In such places$ if the Admiral should fail to appear at the first note of their trumpets$ must the Angels of the Resurrection make search.

Antilles,Lesser Antilles,-72.1972175,16.6487427,After that there was never any more resistance; it was simply a case of extermination$ which the Spaniards easily accomplished by cutting of the heads of women as they passed by$ and impaling infants and little children on their lances as they rode through the villages. Thus$ in the twelve years since the discovery of Columbus$ between half a million and a million natives$ perished; and as the Spanish colonisation spread afterwards from island to island$ and the banner of civilisation and Christianity was borne farther abroad throughout the Indies$ the same hideous process was continued.

In his great castle on the promontory of Sagres$ with the voice of the Atlantic thundering in his ears$ and its mists and sprays bounding his vision$ he felt the full force of the stream$ and stretched his arms to the mysterious West. But the inner light was not yet so brightly kindled that he dared to follow his heart; his ships went south and south again$ to brave on each voyage the dangers and terrors that lay along the unknown African coast$ until at length his captains saw the Cape of Good Hope. South and West and East were in those days confusing terms; for it was the East that men were thinking of when they set their faces to the setting sun$ and it was a new road to the East that they sought when they felt their way southward along the edge of the world. But the rising tide of discovery was working in that moment$ engaging the brains of innumerable sages$ stirring the wonder of innumerable mariners; reaching also$ little by little$ to quarters less immediately concerned with the business of discovery. Ships carried the strange tidings of new coasts and new islands from port to port throughout the Mediterranean; Venetians on the lagoons$ Ligurians on the busy trading wharves of Genoa$ were discussing the great subject; and as the tide rose and spread$ it floated one ship of life after another that was destined for the great business of adventure. Some it inspired to dream and speculate$ and to do no more than that; many a heart also to brave efforts and determinations that were doomed to come to nothing and to end only in failure. And among others who felt the force and was swayed and lifted by the prevailing influence$ there lived$ some four and a half centuries ago$ a little boy playing about the wharves of Genoa$ well known to his companions as Christoforo$ son of Domenico the wool-weaver$ who lived in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello.
Biscay,Biscay$ Spain,-2.6983868,43.2204286,Once more he exhibited his easy mastery of the art of navigation and his extraordinary gift for estimating dead-reckoning. After having been out of sight of land for eight weeks$ and while some of the sailors thought they might be in the Bay of Biscay$ and others that they were in the English Channel$ the Admiral suddenly announced that they were close to Cape Saint Vincent.
Venice,Venice $ Italy,12.3155151,45.4408474,A breath of salt air again will do us no harm as a relief from these perilous balancings of Columbus on the see-saw at Espanola. His true work in this world had indeed already been accomplished. When he smote the rock of western discovery many springs flowed from it$ and some were destined to run in mightier channels than that which he himself followed. Among other men stirred by the news of Columbuss first voyage there was one walking the streets of Bristol in 1496 who was fired to a similar enterprisea man of Venice$ in boyhood named Zuan Caboto$ but now known in England$ where he has some time been settled$ as Captain John Cabot. A sailor and trader who has travelled much through the known sea-roads of this world$ and has a desire to travel upon others not so well known. He has been in the East$ has seen the caravans of Mecca and the goods they carried$ and$ like Columbus$ has conceived in his mind the roundness of the world as a practical fact rather than a mere mathematical theory. Hearing of Columbuss success Cabot sets what machinery in England he has access to in motion to secure for him patents from King Henry VII.; which patents he receives on March 5$ 1496. After spending a long time in preparation$ and being perhaps a little delayed by diplomatic protests from the Spanish Ambassador in London$ he sails from Bristol in May 1497.
Khan,Khan $ Nepal,83.14,28.04,I have already said that I went 107 leagues along the coast of Juana$ from east to west. Thus$ according to my track$ it is larger than England and Scotland together$ for$ besides these 107 leagues$ there were further west two provinces to which I did not go$ one of which is called Cibau$ the people of which are born with tails; which provinces must be about fifty or sixty leagues long$ according to what I can make out from the Indians I have with me$ who know all the islands. The other island (Espanola) is larger in circuit than the whole of Spain$ from the Straits of Gibralter (the Columns) to Fuentarabia in Biscay$ as I sailed 138 long leagues in a direct line from west to east. Once known it must be desired$ and once seen one desires never to leave it; and which$ being taken possession of for their Highnesses$ and the people being at present in a condition lower than I can possibly describe$ the Sovereigns of Castile may dispose of it in any manner they please in the most convenient places. In this Espanola$ and in the best district$ where are gold mines$ and$ on the other side$ from thence to terra firma$ as well as from thence to the Great Khan$ where everything is on a splendid scaleI have taken possession of a large town$ to which I gave the name of La Navidad$ and have built a fort in it$ in every respect complete. And I have left sufficient people in it to take care of it$ with artillery and provisions for more than a year; also a boat and coxswain with the equipments$ in complete friendship with the King of the islands$ to that degree that he delighted to call me and look on me as his brother. And should they fall out with these people$ neither he nor his subjects know anything of weapons$ and go naked$ as I have said$ and they are the most timorous people in the world. The few people left there are sufficient to conquer the country$ and the island would thus remain without danger to them$ they keeping order among themselves.
La,Los Angeles $ United States,-118.2436849,34.0522342,When the Commander Bobadilla came to Santo Domingo$ I was at La Vega$ and the Adelantado at Xaragua$ where that Adrian had made a stand$ but then all was quiet$ and the land rich and all men at peace. On the second day after his arrival$ he created himself Governor$ and appointed officers and made executions$ and proclaimed immunities of gold and tenths and in general of everything else for twenty years$ which is a mans lifetime$ and that he came to pay everybody in full up to that day$ even though they had not rendered service; and he publicly gave notice that$ as for me$ he had charge to send me in irons$ and my brothers likewise$ as he has done$ and that I should nevermore return thither$ nor any other of my family: alleging a thousand disgraceful and discourteous things about me. All this took place on the second day after his arrival$ as I have said$ and while I was absent at a distance$ without my knowing either of him or of his arrival.
Crooked,San Jose $ United States,-121.8626766,37.3265496,But life$ even to the discoverer of a New World$ does not consist of wandering in the groves$ and listening to the singing birds$ and smelling the flowers$ and remembering the May nights of Andalusia. There was gold to be found and the mainland of Cathay to be discovered$ and a letter$ written by the sovereigns at his earnest request$ to be delivered to the Great Khan. The natives had told him of an island called Samoete to the southward$ which was said to contain a quantity of gold. He sailed thither on the 19th$ and called it Isabella; its modern name is Crooked Island. He anchored here and found it to be but another step in the ascending scale of his delight; it was greener and more beautiful than any of the islands he had yet seen. He spent some time looking for the gold$ but could not find any; although he heard of the island of Cuba$ which he took to be the veritable Cipango. He weighed anchor on October 24th and sailed south-west$ encountering some bad weather on the way; but on Sunday the 28th he came up with the north coast of Cuba and entered the mouth of a river which is the modern Nuevitas. To the island of Cuba he gave the name of Juana in honour of the young prince to whom his son Diego had been appointed a page.
Hayna,Herxheim bei Landau (Pfalz) $ Germany,8.2038497,49.1215193,Columbus$ left idle in the absence of Bartholomew$ listening to the continuous drip and patter of the rain on the leaves and the water$ begins to dream againto dream of gold and geography. Remembers that David left three thousand quintals of gold from the Indies to Solomon for the decoration of the Temple; remembers that Josephus said it came from the Golden Chersonesus; decides that enough gold could never have been got from the mines of Hayna in Espanola; and concludes that the Ophir of Solomon must be here in Veragua and not there in Espanola. It was always here and now with Columbus; and as he moved on his weary sea pilgrimages these mythical lands with their glittering promise moved about with him$ like a pillar of fire leading him through the dark night of his quest.
Markland,Markland$ York Township$ IN 47020$ USA,-84.9866158,38.7820066,The Egyptians$ the Tartars$ the Canaanites$ the Chinese$ the Arabians$ the Welsh$ and the Scandinavians have all been credited with the colonisation of America; but the only race from the Old World which had almost certainly been there were the Scandinavians. In the year 983 the coast of Greenland was visited by Eric the Red$ the son of a Norwegian noble$ who was banished for the crime of murder. Some fifteen years later Erics son Lief made an expedition with thirty-five men and a ship in the direction of the new land. They came to a coast where there were nothing but ice mountains having the appearance of slate; this country they named Hellulandthat is$ Land of Slate. This country is our Newfoundland. Standing out to sea again$ they reached a level wooded country with white sandy cliffs$ which they called Markland$ or Land of Wood$ which is our Nova Scotia. Next they reached an island east of Markland$ where they passed the winter$ and as one of their number who had wandered some distance inland had found vines and grapes$ Lief named the country Vinland or Vine Land$ which is the country we call New England. The Scandinavians continued to make voyages to the West and South; and finally Thorfinn Karlsefne$ an Icelander$ made a great expedition in the spring of 1007 with ships and material for colonisation. He made much progress to the southwards$ and the Icelandic accounts of the climate and soil and characteristics of the country leave no doubt that Greenland and Nova Scotia were discovered and colonised at this time.
Quinto,Quinto $ Switzerland,8.6929161,46.5099625,In 1450 he bought a pleasant house at Quarto$ a village on the sea-shore about a mile to the west of Quinto and about five miles to the east of Genoa. It was probably a pure speculation$ as he immediately leased the house for two years$ and never lived in it himself$ although it was a pleasant place$ with an orchard of olives and figs and various other treesarboratum olivis ficubus et aliis diversis arboribus. His next recorded transaction is in 1466$ when he went security for a friend$ doubtless with disastrous results. In 1473 he sold the house at the Olive Gate$ that suburban dwelling where probably Christopher was born$ and in 1474 he invested the proceeds of that sale in a piece of land which I have referred to before$ situated in the suburbs of Savona$ with which were sold those agreeable and useless wine-vats. Domenico was living at Savona then$ and the property which he so fatuously acquired consisted of two large pieces of land on the Via Valcalda$ containing a few vines$ a plantation of fruit-trees$ and a large area of shrub and underwood. The price$ however$ was never paid in full$ and was the cause of a lawsuit which dragged on for forty years$ and was finally settled by Don Diego Columbus$ Christophers son$ who sent a special authority from Hispaniola.
Savona,Gulph Mills $ United States,-75.340492,40.061828,The see-saw motion of all affairs with which Columbus had to do was in full swing. We have seen him patching up matters in Espanola; hurrying to Spain just in time to rescue his damaged reputation and do something to restore it; and now when he had come back it was but a sorry tale that Bartholomew had to tell him. A fortress had been built at the Hayna gold-mines$ but provisions had been so scarce that there had been something like a famine among the workmen there; no digging had been done$ no planting$ no making of the place fit for human occupation and industry. Bartholomew had been kept busy in collecting the native tribute$ and in planning out the beginnings of the settlement at the mouth of the river Ozema$ which was at first called the New Isabella$ but was afterwards named San Domingo in honour of old Domenico at Savona. The cacique Behechio had been giving trouble; had indeed marched out with an army against Bartholomew$ but had been more or less reconciled by the intervention of his sister Anacaona$ widow of the late Caonabo$ who had apparently transferred her affections to Governor Bartholomew. The battle was turned into a friendly pagan festivalone of the last ever held on that once happy islandin which native girls danced in a green grove$ with the beautiful Anacaona$ dressed only in garlands$ carried on a litter in their midst.
Prado,Madrid $ Spain,-3.6921271,40.4137818,At the house of Alonso de Quintanilla$ however$ Columbus was not altogether wasting his time. He met there some of the great persons of the Court$ among them the celebrated Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza$ Archbishop of Toledo and Grand Cardinal of Spain. This was far too great a man to be at this time anything like a friend of Columbus; but Columbus had been presented to him; the Cardinal would know his name$ and what his business was; and that is always a step towards consideration. Cabrero$ the royal Chamberlain$ was also often a fellow-guest at the Treasurers table; and with him Columbus contracted something like a friendship. Every one who met him liked him; his dignity$ his simplicity of thought and manner$ his experience of the sea$ and his calm certainty and conviction about the stupendous thing which he proposed to do$ could not fail to attract the liking and admiration of those with whom he came in contact. In the meantime a committee appointed by the Queen sat upon his proposals. The committee met under the presidentship of Hernando de Talavera$ the prior of the monastery of Santa Maria del Prado$ near Valladolid$ a pious ecclesiastic$ who had the rare quality of honesty$ and who was therefore a favourite with Queen Isabella; she afterwards created him Archbishop of Granada. He was not$ however$ poor honest soul! quite the man to grasp and grapple with this wild scheme for a voyage across the ocean. Once more Columbus$ as in Portugal$ set forth his views with eloquence and conviction; and once more$ at the tribunal of learning$ his unlearned proposals were examined and condemned. Not only was Columbuss Idea regarded as scientifically impossible$ but it was also held to come perilously near to heresy$ in its assumption of a state of affairs that was clearly at variance with the writings of the Fathers and the sacred Scriptures themselves.
Puerto,Puerto $ Spain,-17.9439247,28.6528803,Although the journey from Jamaica to Espanola had been accomplished in four days by Mendez in his canoe$ the caravels conveying the party rescued from Puerto Santa Gloria were seven weary weeks on this short voyage; a strong north-west wind combining with the west-going current to make their progress to the north-west impossible for weeks at a time. It was not until the 13th of August 1503 that they anchored in the harbour of San Domingo$ and Columbus once more set foot$ after an absence of more than two years$ on the territory from the governorship of which he had been deposed.
Higuamota,Santo Domingo $ Dominican Republic,-69.9398768,18.4555369,Of pretty Higuamota$ who once lived like a dryad among the groves of Espanola and has been dead now for so long$ we know nothing except that she was beautiful$ which$ although she doubtless did not think so while she lived$ turns out to have been the most important thing about her. Young Guevara$ coming to stay with his cousin Adrian$ becomes a visitor at the house of Anacaona; sees the pretty daughter and falls in love with her. Other people also$ it appears$ have been in a similar state$ but Higuamota is not very accessible; a fact which of course adds to the interest of the chase$ and turns dissolute Fernandos idle preference into something like a passion. Roldan$ who has also had an eye upon her$ and apparently no more than an eye$ discovers that Fernando$ in order to gratify his passion$ is proposing to go the absurd length of marrying the young woman$ and has sent for a priest for that purpose. Roldan$ instigated thereto by primitive forces$ thinks it would be impolitic for a Spanish grandee to marry with a heathen; very well$ then$ Fernando will have her baptizednothing simpler when water and a priest are handy. Roldan$ seeing that the young man is serious$ becomes peremptory$ and orders him to leave Xaragua. Fernando ostentatiously departs$ but is discovered a little later actually living in the house of Anacaona$ who apparently is sympathetic to Loves young dream. Once more ordered away$ this time with anger and threats$ Guevara changes his tune and implores Roldan to let him stay$ promising that he will give up the marriage project and also$ no doubt$ the no-marriage project. But Guevara has sympathisers. The mutineers have not forgiven Roldan for deserting them and becoming a lawful instead of an unlawful ruler. They are all on the side of Guevara$ who accordingly moves to the next stage of island procedure$ and sets on foot some kind of plot to kill Roldan and the Admiral. Fortunately where there is treachery it generally works both ways; this plot came to the ears of the authorities; the conspirators were arrested and sent to San Domingo.
Cordova,Cordova $ United States,-145.7525414,60.5424087,The scene thus conjured up is one peculiar to the time and condition of these people$ and is eloquent and pathetic enough: the little ship staggering and bounding along before the wind$ and the frightened crew$ who had gone through so many other dangers$ huddled together under the forecastle$ drawing peas out of a cap$ crossing themselves$ making vows upon their knees$ and seeking to hire the protection of the Virgin by their offers of candles and pilgrimages. Poor Christopher$ standing in his drenched oilskins and clinging to a piece of rigging$ had his own searching of heart and examining of conscience. He was aware of the feverish anxiety and impatience that he felt$ now that he had been successful in discovering a New World$ to bring home the news and fruits of it; his desire to prove true what he had promised was so great that$ in his own graphic phrase$ it seemed to him that every gnat could disturb and impede it; and he attributed this anxiety to his lack of faith in God. He comforted himself$ like Robinson Crusoe in a similar extremity$ by considering on the other hand what favours God had shown him$ and by remembering that it was to the glory of God that the fruits of his discovery were to be dedicated. But in the meantime here he was in a ship insufficiently ballasted (for she was now practically empty of provisions$ and they had found it necessary to fill the wine and water casks with salt water in order to trim her) and flying before a tempest such as he had never experienced in his life. As a last resource$ and in order to give his wonderful news a chance of reaching Spain in case the ship were lost$ he went into his cabin and somehow or other managed to write on a piece of parchment a brief account of his discoveries$ begging any one who might find it to carry it to the Spanish Sovereigns. He tied up the parchment in a waxed cloth$ and put it into a large barrel without any one seeing him$ and then ordered the barrel to be thrown into the sea$ which the crew took to be some pious act of sacrifice or devotion. Then he went back on deck and watched the last of the daylight going and the green seas swelling and thundering about his little ship$ and thought anxiously of his two little boys at school in Cordova$ and wondered what would become of them if he were lost. The next morning the wind had changed a little$ though it was still very high; but he was able to hoist up the bonnet or topsail$ and presently the sea began to go down a little. When the sun rose they saw land to the east-north-east. Some of them thought it was Madeira$ others the rock of Cintra in Portugal; the pilots said it was the coast of Spain$ the Admiral thought it was the Azores; but at any rate it was land of some kind. The sun was shining upon it and upon the tumbling sea; and although the waves were still raging mast-high and the wind still blowing a hard gale$ the miserable crew were able to hope that$ having lived through the night$ they could live through the day also. They had to beat about to make the land$ which was now ahead of them$ now on the beam$ and now astern; and although they had first sighted it at sunrise on Friday morning it was early on Monday morning$ February 18th$ before Columbus was able to cast anchor off the northern coast of an island which he discovered to be the island of Santa Maria in the Azores. On this day Columbus found time to write a letter to Luis de Santangel$ the royal Treasurer$ giving a full account of his voyage and discoveries; which letter he kept and despatched on the 4th of March$ after he had arrived in Lisbon. Since it contained a postscript written at the last moment we shall read it at that stage of our narrative. The inhabitants of Santa Maria received the voyagers with astonishment$ for they believed that nothing could have lived through the tempest that had been raging for the last fortnight. They were greatly excited by the story of the discoveries; and the Admiral$ who had now quite recovered command of himself$ was able to pride himself on the truth of his dead-reckoning$ which had proved to be so much more accurate than that of the pilots.
Bohio,791 E Tremont Ave$ Bronx$ NY 10460$ USA,-73.8879167,40.8441217,The Pinta was out of sight the next morning$ and the little Nina was all that the Admiral had to rely upon for convoy. They were now near the east end of the north coast of Cuba$ and they stood in to a harbour which the Admiral called Santa Catalina$ and which is now called Cayo de Moa. As the importance of the Nina to the expedition had been greatly increased by the defection of the Pinta$ Columbus went on board and examined her. He found that some of her spars were in danger of giving way; and as there was a forest of pine trees rising from the shore he was able to procure a new mizzen mast and latine yard in case it should be necessary to replace those of the Nina. The next morning he weighed anchor at sunrise and continued east along the coast. He had now arrived at the extreme end of Cuba$ and was puzzled as to what course he should take. Believing Cuba$ as he did$ to be the mainland of Cathay$ he would have liked to follow the coast in its trend to the south-west$ in the hope of coming upon the rich city of Quinsay; but on the other hand there was looming to the south-west some land which the natives with him assured him was Bohio$ the place where all the gold was. He therefore held on his course; but when the Indians found that he was really going to these islands they became very much alarmed$ and made signs that the people would eat them if they went there; and$ in order further to dissuade the Admiral$ they added that the people there had only one eye$ and the faces$ of dogs. As it did not suit Columbus to believe them he said that they were lying$ and that he felt that the island must belong to the domain of the Great Khan. He therefore continued his course$ seeing many beautiful and enchanting bays opening before him$ and longing to go into them$ but heroically stifling his curiosity$ because he was detained more than he desired by the pleasure and delight he felt in seeing and gazing on the beauty and freshness of those countries wherever he entered$ and because he did not wish to be delayed in prosecuting what he was engaged upon; and for these reasons he remained that night beating about and standing off and on until day. He could not trust himself$ that is to say$ to anchor in these beautiful harbours$ for he knew he would be tempted to go ashore and waste valuable time exploring the woods; and so he remained instead$ beating about in the open sea.
Hope,Malvern $ United States,-92.8252306,34.3693073,Another great conquest of the salt unknown taken place a few days before Columbus sailed on his third voyage. The accidental discovery of the Cape by Bartholomew Diaz in 1486 had not been neglected by Portugal; and the achievements of Columbus$ while they cut off Portuguese enterprise from the western ocean$ had only stimulated it to greater activity within its own spheres. Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon in July 1497; by the end of November he had rounded the Cape of Good Hope; and in May 1498$ after a long voyage full of interest$ peril$ and hardship he had landed at Calicut on the shores of the true India. He came back in 1499 with a battered remnant$ his crew disabled by sickness and exhaustion$ and half his ships lost; but he had in fact discovered a road for trade and adventure to the East that was not paved with promises$ dreams$ or mad affidavits$ but was a real and tangible achievement$ bringing its reward in commerce and wealth for Portugal. At that very moment Columbus was groping round the mainland of South America$ thinking it to be the coast of Cathay$ and the Garden of Eden$ and God knows what other cosmographicaltheological abstractions; and Portugal$ busy with her arrangements for making money$ could afford for the moment to look on undismayed at the development of the mine of promises discovered by the Spanish Admiral.
Terra-Rossa,Dundee $ United States,-123.041153,45.296481,Of Antonio and Battestina$ the uncle and aunt of Columbus$ we know next to nothing. Uncle Antonio inherited the estate of Terra-Rossa$ Aunt Battestina was married in the valley; and so no more of either of them; except that Antonio$ who also married$ had sons$ cousins of Columbus$ who in after years$ when he became famous$ made themselves unpleasant$ as poor relations will$ by recalling themselves to his remembrance and suggesting that something might be done for them. I have a belief$ supported by no historical fact or document$ that between the families of Domenico and Antonio there was a mild cousinly feud. I believe they did not like each other. Domenico$ as we shall see presently$ was sanguine and venturesome$ a great buyer and seller$ a maker of bargains in which he generally came off second best. Antonio$ who settled in Terra-Rossa$ the paternal property$ doubtless looked askance at these enterprises from his vantage-ground of a settled income; doubtless also$ on the occasion of visits exchanged between the two families$ he would comment upon the unfortunate enterprises of his brother; and as the children of both brothers grew up$ they would inherit and exaggerate$ as children will$ this settled difference between their respective parents. This$ of course$ may be entirely untrue$ but I think it possible$ and even likely; for Columbus in after life displayed a very tender regard for members of his family$ but never to our knowledge makes any reference to these cousins of his$ till they send emissaries to him in his hour of triumph. At any rate$ among the influences that surrounded him at Genoa we may reckon this uncle and aunt and their childrendim ghosts to us$ but to him real people$ who walked and spoke$ and blinked their eyes and moved their limbs$ like the men and women of our own time. Less of a ghost to us$ though still a very shadowy and doubtful figure$ is Domenico himself$ Christophers father. He at least is a man in whom we can feel a warm interest$ as the one who actually begat and reared the man of our story. We shall see him later$ and chiefly in difficulties; executing deeds and leases$ and striking a great variety of legal attitudes$ to the witnessing of which various members of his family were called in. Little enough good did they to him at the time$ poor Domenico; but he was a benefactor to posterity without knowing it$ and in these grave notarial documents preserved almost the only evidence that we have as to the early days of his illustrious son. A kind$ sanguine man$ this Domenico$ who$ if he failed to make a good deal of money in his various enterprises$ at least had some enjoyment of them$ as the man who buys and sells and strikes legal attitudes in every age desires and has. He was a wool-carder by trade$ but that was not enough for him; he must buy little bits of estates here and there; must even keep a tavern$ where he and his wife could entertain the foreign sailors and hear the news of the world; where also$ although perhaps they did not guess it$ a sharp pair of ears were also listening$ and a pair of round eyes gazing$ and an inquisitive face set in astonishment at the strange tales that went about.
Te,Tulsa $ United States,-95.99931,36.151414,The Sovereigns were delighted and profoundly impressed. Columbus wound up his address with an eloquent peroration concerning the glory to Christendom of these new discoveries; and there followed an impressive silence$ during which the Sovereigns sank on their knees and raised hands and tearful eyes to heaven$ an example in which they were followed by the whole of the assembly; and an appropriate gesture enough$ seeing what was to come of it all. The choir of the Chapel Royal sang a solemn Te Deum on the spot; and the Sovereigns and nobles$ bishops$ archbishops$ grandees$ hidalgos$ chamberlains$ treasurers$ chancellors and other courtiers$ being exhausted by these emotions$ retired to dinner.
Garden,Oklahoma City $ United States,-97.5618365,35.5178283,The anxiety of Columbus to communicate the names of things before he had made sure of their substance received another rude chastisement in the events that followed the receipt in Spain of his letter announcing the discovery of the Garden of Eden and the land of pearls. People in Spain were not greatly interested in his theories of the terrestrial Paradise; but more than one adventurer pricked up his ears at the name of pearls$ and among the first was our old friend Alonso de Ojeda$ who had returned some time before from Espanola and was living in Spain. His position as a member of Columbuss force on the second voyage and the distinction he had gained there gave him special opportunities of access to the letters and papers sent home by Columbus; and he found no difficulty in getting Fonseca to show him the maps and charts of the coast of Paria sent back by the Admiral$ the veritable pearls which had been gathered$ and the enthusiastic descriptions of the wealth of this new coast. Knowing something of Espanola$ and of the Admiral also$ and reading in the despatches of the turbulent condition of the colony$ he had a shrewd idea that Columbuss hands would be kept pretty full in Espanola itself$ and that he would have no opportunity for some time to make any more voyages of discovery. He therefore represented to Fonseca what a pity it would be if all this revenue should remain untapped just because one man had not time to attend to it$ and he proposed that he should take out an expedition at his own cost and share the profits with the Crown.
Christi,Oklahoma City $ United States,-97.3667524,35.4325677,The most urgent need was to build the new settlement and lay out a town. Several small parties were sent out to reconnoitre the coast in both directions$ but none of them found a suitable place; and on December 7th the whole fleet sailed to the east in the hope of finding a better position. They were driven by adverse winds into a harbour some thirty miles to the east of Monte Christi$ and when they went ashore they decided that this was as good a site as any for the new town. There was about a quarter of a mile of level sandy beach enclosed by headlands on either side; there was any amount of rock and stones for building$ and there was a natural barrier of hills and mountains a mile or so inland that would protect a camp from that side.The soil was very fertile$ the vegetation luxuriant; and the mango swamps a little way inland drained into a basin or lake which provided an unlimited water supply. Columbus therefore set about establishing a little town$ to which he gave the name of Isabella. Streets and squares were laid out$ and rows of temporary buildings made of wood and thatched with grass were hastily run up for the accommodation of the members of the expedition$ while the foundations of three stone buildings were also marked out and the excavations put in hand. These buildings were the church$ the storehouse$ and a residence for Columbus as Governor-General. The stores were landed$ the horses and cattle accommodated ashore$ the provisions$ ammunition$ and agricultural implements also. Labourers were set to digging out the foundations of the stone buildings$ carpenters to cutting down trees and running up the light wooden houses that were to serve as barracks for the present; masons were employed in hewing stones and building landing-piers; and all the crowd of well-born adventurers were set to work with their hands$ much to their disgust. This was by no means the life they had imagined$ and at the first sign of hard work they turned sulky and discontented. There was$ to be sure$ some reason for their discontent. Things had not quite turned out as Columbus had promised they should; there was no store of gold$ nor any sign of great desire on the part of the natives to bring any; and to add to their other troubles$ illness began to break out in the camp. The freshly-turned rank soil had a bad effect on the health of the garrison; the lake$ which had promised to be so pleasant a feature in the new town$ gave off dangerous malarial vapours at night; and among the sufferers from this trouble was Columbus himself$ who endured for some weeks all the pains and lassitude of the disagreeable fever.

Susanna$ who had been the witness of his melancholy transactions for so many years$ and possibly the mainstay of that declining household$ died in 1494; but not$ we may hope$ before she had heard of the fame of her son Christopher. Domenico$ in receipt of a pension from the famous Admiral of the Ocean$ and no doubt talking with a deal of pride and inaccuracy about the discovery of the New World$ lived on until 1498; when he died also$ and vanished out of this world. He had fulfilled a noble destiny in being the father of Christopher Columbus.
Tanamo,Caracas $ Venezuela,-66.8747162,10.4966339,For two days they ran along the coast with a fair wind; but on the 14th a head wind and heavy sea drove them into the shelter of a deep harbour called by Columbus Puerto del Principe$ which is the modern Tanamo. The number of islands off this part of the coast of Cuba confirmed Columbus in his profound geographical error; he took them to be those innumerable islands which in the maps of the world are placed at the end of the east. He erected a great wooden cross on an eminence here$ as he always did when he took possession of a new place$ and made some boat excursions among the islands in the harbour. On the 17th of November two of the six youths whom he had taken on board the week before swam ashore and escaped. When he started again on his voyage he was greatly inconvenienced by the wind$ which veered about between the north and south of east$ and was generally a foul wind for him. There is some difference of opinion as to what point of the wind the ships of Columbuss time would sail on; but there is no doubt that they were extremely unhandy in anything approaching a head wind$ and that they were practically no good at all at beating to windward. The shape of their hulls$ the ungainly erections ahead and astern$ and their comparatively light hold on the water$ would cause them to drift to leeward faster than they could work to windward. In this head wind$ therefore$ Columbus found that he was making very little headway$ although he stood out for long distances to the northward. On Wednesday$ November 21st$ occurred a most disagreeable incident$ which might easily have resulted in the Admirals never reaching Spain alive. Some time in the afternoon he noticed the Pinta standing away ahead of him in a direction which was not the course which he was steering; and he signalled her to close up with him. No answer$ however$ was made to his signal$ which he repeated$ but to which he failed to attract any response. He was standing south at the time$ the wind being well in the north-east; and Martin Alonso Pinzon$ whose caravel pointed into the wind much better than the unhandy Santa Maria$ was standing to the east. When evening fell he was still in sight$ at a distance of sixteen miles. Columbus was really concerned$ and fired lombards and flew more signals of invitation; but there was no reply. In the evening he shortened sail and burned a torch all night$ because it appeared that Martin Alonso was returning to me; and the night was very clear$ and there was a nice little breeze by which to come to me if he wished. But he did not wish$ and he did not come.
Isla,Isla$ TX 75959$ USA,-93.84546429999999,31.5051796,After the shattering experience of the storm$ Columbus$ although he did not return to San Domingo$ remained for some time on the coast of Espanola repairing his ships and resting his exhausted crews. There were threatenings of another storm which delayed them still further$ and it was not until the middle of July that the Admiral was able to depart on the real purpose of his voyage. His object was to strike the mainland far to the westward of the Gulf of Paria$ and so by following it back eastward to find the passage which he believed to exist. But the winds and currents were very baffling; he was four days out of sight of land after touching at an island north of Jamaica; and finally$ in some bewilderment$ he altered his course more and more northerly until he found his whereabouts by coming in sight of the archipelago off the south-western end of Cuba which he had called the Gardens. From here he took a departure south-west$ and on the 30th of July came in sight of a small island off the northern coast of Honduras which he called Isla de Pinos$ and from which he could see the hills of the mainland. At this island he found a canoe of immense size with a sort of house or caboose built amidships$ in which was established a cacique with his family and dependents; and the people in the canoe showed signs of more advanced civilisation than any seen by Columbus before in these waters. They wore clothing$ they had copper hatchets$ and bells$ and palm-wood swords in the edges of which were set sharp blades of flint. They had a fermented liquor$ a kind of maize beer which looked like English ale; they had some kind of money or medium of exchange also$ and they told the Admiral that there was land to the west where all these things existed and many more. It is strange and almost inexplicable that he did not follow this trail to the westward; if he had done so he would have discovered Mexico. But one thing at a time always occupied him to the exclusion of everything else; his thoughts were now turned to the eastward$ where he supposed the Straits were; and the significance of this canoe full of natives was lost upon him.
Candia,Candia $ United States,-71.2888619,43.0612461,The next step in Columbuss career was a move to Porto Santo$ which probably took place very soon after his marriagethat is to say$ in the year 1479. It is likely that he had the chance of making a voyage there; perhaps even of commanding a ship$ for his experience of the sea and skill as a navigator must by this time have raised him above the rank of an ordinary seaman; and in that case nothing would be more natural than that he should take his young wife with him to visit her brother Bartolomeo$ and to see the family property. It is one of the charms of the seamans profession that he travels free all over the world; and if he has no house or other fixed possessions that need to be looked after he has the freedom of the world$ and can go where he likes free of cost. Porto Santo and Madeira$ lying in the track of the busiest trade on the Atlantic coast$ would provide Columbus with an excellent base from which to make other voyages; so it was probably with a heart full of eager anticipation for the future$ and sense of quiet happiness in the present$ that in the year 1479 Signor Cristoforo Colombo (for he did not yet call himself Senor Cristoval Colon) set out for Porto Santoa lonely rock some miles north of Madeira. Its southern shore is a long sweeping bay of white sand$ with a huddle of sand-hills beyond$ and cliffs and peaks of basalt streaked with lava fringing the other shores. When Columbus and his bride arrived there the place was almost as bare as it is to-day. There were the governors house; the settlement of Portuguese who worked in the mills and sugar-fields; the mills themselves$ with the cultivated sugar-fields behind them; and the vineyards$ with the dwarf Malmsey vines pegged down to the ground$ which Prince Henry had imported from Candia fifty years before. The forest of dragon-trees that had once covered the island was nearly all gone. The wood had all been used either for building$ making boats$ or for fuel; and on the fruit of the few trees that were left a herd of pigs was fattened. There was frequent communication by boat with Madeira$ which was the chief of all the Atlantic islands$ and the headquarters of the sugar trade; and Porto Santo itself was a favourite place of call for passing ships. So that it was by no means lonely for Christopher Columbus and his wife$ even if they had not had the society of the governor and his settlement.
Martinique,Martinique,-61.024174,14.641528,The fleet as usual made the Canary Islands$ where they arrived on the 20th of May$ and stopped for five days taking in wood and water and fresh provisions. Columbus was himself againalways more himself at sea than anywhere else; he was following a now familiar road that had no difficulties or dangers for him; and there is no record of the voyage out except that it was quick and prosperous$ with the trade wind blowing so steadily that from the time they left the Canaries until they made land twenty days later they had hardly to touch a sheet or a halliard. The first land they made was the island of Martinique$ where wood and water were taken in and the men sent ashore to wash their linen. To young Ferdinand$ but fourteen years old$ this voyage was like a fairy tale come true$ and his delight in everything that he saw must have added greatly to Christophers pleasure and interest in the voyage. They only stayed a few days at Martinique and then sailed westward along the chain of islands until they came to Porto Rico$ where they put in to the sunny harbour which they had discovered on a former voyage.
Palacios,Palacios $ United States,-96.217467,28.7080461,While he was waiting for their summons at Los Palacios$ a small town near Seville$ he was the guest of the curate of that place$ Andrez Bernaldez$ who had been chaplain to Christophers old friend DEA$ the Archbishop of Seville. This good priest evidently proved a staunch friend to Columbus at this anxious period of his life$ for the Admiral left many important papers in his charge when he again left Spain$ and no small part of the scant contemporary information about Columbus that has come down to us is contained in the Historia de los Reyes Catolicos$ which Bernaldez wrote after the death of Columbus.
Higua,Higua $ India,82.6820956,27.3476492,The fifth chief$ Cotabanama$ Lord of the province of Higua$ made the last stand against Ovando in defence of the native right to existence$ and was only defeated after severe battles and dreadful slaughters. His territory was among the mountains$ and his last insurrection was caused$ as so many others had been$ by the intolerable conduct of the Spaniards towards the wives and daughters of the Indians. Collecting all his warriors$ Cotabanama attacked the Spanish posts in his neighbourhood. At every engagement his troops were defeated and dispersed$ but only to collect again$ fight again with even greater fury$ be defeated and dispersed again$ and rally again against the Spaniards. They literally fought to the death. After every battle the Spaniards made a massacre of all the natives they could find$ old men$ children$ and pregnant women being alike put to the sword or burned in their houses. When their companions fell beside them$ instead of being frightened they became more furious; and when they were wounded they would pluck the arrows out of their bodies and hurl them back at the Spaniards$ falling dead in the very act. After one such severe defeat and massacre the natives scattered for many months$ hiding among the mountains and trying to collect and succour their decimated families; but the Spaniards$ who with their dogs grew skilful at tracking the Indians and found it pleasant sport$ came upon them in the places of refuge where little groups of them were sheltering their women and children$ and there slowly and cruelly slaughtered them$ often with the addition of tortures and torments in order to induce them to reveal the whereabouts of other bands. When it was possible the Spaniards sometimes hanged thirteen of them in a row in commemoration of their Blessed Saviour and the Twelve Apostles; and while they were hanging$ and before they had quite died$ they would hack at them with their swords in order to test the edge of the steel. At the last stand$ when the fierceness and bitterness of the contest rose to a height on both sides$ Cotabanama was captured and a plan made to broil him slowly to death; but for some reason this plan was not carried out$ and the brave chief was taken to San Domingo and publicly hanged like a thief.
SPAIN,Spain,-3.74922,40.46366700000001,CHAPTER VI. IN SPAIN AGAIN
Saona,Saona Island$ 23000$ Dominican Republic,-68.67972639999999,18.1530876,It was on the 20th of August that Columbus$ having the day before seen the last of the dim blue hills of Jamaica$ sighted again the long peninsula of Hayti$ called by him Cape San Miguel$ but known to us as Cape Tiburon; although it was not until he was hailed by a cacique who called out to him Almirante$ Almirante$ that the seaworn mariners realised with joy that the island must be Espanola. But they were a long way from Isabella yet. They sailed along the south coast$ meeting contrary winds$ and at one point landing nine men who were to cross the island$ and try to reach Isabella by land. Week followed week$ and they made very poor progress. In the beginning of September they were caught in a severe tempest$ which separated the ships for a time$ and held the Admiral weather-bound for eight days. There was an eclipse of the moon during this period$ and he took advantage of it to make an observation for longitude$ by which he found himself to be 5 hrs. 23 min.$ or 80 deg. 40$ west of Cadiz. In this observation there is an error of eighteen degrees$ the true longitude of the island of Saona$ where the observation was taken$ being 62 deg. 20 west of Cadiz; and the error is accounted for partly by the inaccuracy of the tables of Regiomontanus and partly by the crudity and inexactness of the Admirals methods. On the 24th of September they at last reached the easternmost point of Espanola$ named by Columbus San Rafael. They stood to the east a little longer$ and discovered the little island of Mona$ which lies between Espanola and Puerto Rico; and from thence shaped their course west-by-north for Isabella. And no sooner had the course been set for home than the Admiral suddenly and completely collapsed; was carried unconscious to his cabin; and lay there in such extremity that his companions gave him up for lost.
Lucar,Santa María $ Argentina,-66.0498229,-26.6999216,I wrote a very long letter to his Highness as soon as I arrived here$ fully stating the evils which require a prompt and efficient remedy at once. I have received no reply$ nor have I seen any provision made in the matter. Some vessels are detained in San Lucar by the weather. I have told these gentlemen of the Board of Trade that they must order them held until the King$ our Lord$ makes provision in the matter$ either by some person with other people$ or by writing. This is very necessary and I know what I say. It is necessary that the authorities should order all the ports searched diligently$ to see that no one goes yonder to the Indies without licence. I have already said that there is a great deal of gold collected in straw houses without any means of defence$ and there are many disorderly people in the country$ and that the Governor is hated$ and that little punishment is inflicted and has been inflicted upon those who have committed crimes and have come out with their treasonable conduct approved.
Salvador,El Salvador,-88.89653,13.794185,The first that I discovered I named San Salvador$ in remembrance of that Almighty Power which had so miraculously bestowed them. The Indians call it Guanahani. To the second I assigned the name of Santa Marie de Conception; to the third that of Fernandina; to the fourth that of Isabella; to the fifth Juana; and so on$ to every one a new name.
Israel,Israel,34.851612,31.046051,I mounted to the top of the ship crying out with a weak voice$ weeping bitterly$ to the commanders of your Majesties army$ and calling again to the four winds to help; but they did not answer me. Tired out$ I fell asleep and sighing I heard a voice very full of pity which spoke these words: O fool! and slow to believe and to serve Him$ thy God and the God of all. What did He more for Moses? and for David His servant? Since thou wast born He had always so great care for thee. When He saw thee in an age with which He was content He made thy name sound marvellously through the world. The Indies$ which are so rich apart of the world$ He has given to thee as thine. Thou hast distributed them wherever it has pleased thee; He gave thee power so to do. Of the bonds of the ocean which were locked with so strong chains He gave thee the keys$ and thou wast obeyed in all the land$ and among the Christians thou hast acquired a good and honourable reputation. What did He more for the people of Israel when He brought them out of Egypt? or yet for David$ whom from being a shepherd He made King of Judea? Turn to Him and recognise thine error$ for His mercy is infinite. Thine old age will be no hindrance to all great things. Many very great inheritances are in His power. Abraham was more than one hundred years old when he begat Isaac and also Sarah was not young. Thou art calling for uncertain aid. Answer me$ who has afflicted thee so much and so many timesGod or the world? The privileges and promises which God makes He never breaks to any one; nor does He say after having received the service that His intention was not so and it is to be understood in another manner: nor imposes martyrdom to give proof of His power. He abides by the letter of His word. All that He promises He abundantly accomplishes. This is His way. I have told thee what the Creator hath done for thee and does for all. Now He shows me the reward and payment of thy suffering and which thou hast passed in the service of others. And thus half dead$ I heard everything; but I could never find an answer to make to words so certain$ and only I wept for my errors. He$ who ever he might be$ finished speaking$ saying: Trust and fear not$ for thy tribulations are written in marble and not without reason.
Barcelona,Barcelona $ Spain,2.1734035,41.3850639,Columbus considers this family$ and thinks wistfully how well they would look in Barcelona. Father dressed in a cap of gold and green jewels$ necklace and earrings of the same; mother decked out in similar regalia$ with the addition of a small cotton apron; two sons and five brothers dressed principally in a feather or two; two daughters mother-naked$ except that the elder$ a handsome girl of eighteen$ wears a jewelled girdle from which depends a tablet as big as an ivy leaf$ made of various coloured stones embroidered on cotton. What an exhibit for one of the triumphal processions: Native royal family$ complete! But Columbus thinks also of the scarcity of provisions on board his ships$ and wonders how all these royalties would like to live on a pint of sour wine and a rotten biscuit each per day. Alas! there is not sour wine and rotten biscuit enough for his own people; it is still a long way to Espanola; and he is obliged to make polite excuses$ and to say that he will come back for his majesty another time.
Fuentarabia,Hondarribia $ Spain,-1.8001488,43.3708434,I have already said that I went 107 leagues along the coast of Juana$ from east to west. Thus$ according to my track$ it is larger than England and Scotland together$ for$ besides these 107 leagues$ there were further west two provinces to which I did not go$ one of which is called Cibau$ the people of which are born with tails; which provinces must be about fifty or sixty leagues long$ according to what I can make out from the Indians I have with me$ who know all the islands. The other island (Espanola) is larger in circuit than the whole of Spain$ from the Straits of Gibralter (the Columns) to Fuentarabia in Biscay$ as I sailed 138 long leagues in a direct line from west to east. Once known it must be desired$ and once seen one desires never to leave it; and which$ being taken possession of for their Highnesses$ and the people being at present in a condition lower than I can possibly describe$ the Sovereigns of Castile may dispose of it in any manner they please in the most convenient places. In this Espanola$ and in the best district$ where are gold mines$ and$ on the other side$ from thence to terra firma$ as well as from thence to the Great Khan$ where everything is on a splendid scaleI have taken possession of a large town$ to which I gave the name of La Navidad$ and have built a fort in it$ in every respect complete. And I have left sufficient people in it to take care of it$ with artillery and provisions for more than a year; also a boat and coxswain with the equipments$ in complete friendship with the King of the islands$ to that degree that he delighted to call me and look on me as his brother. And should they fall out with these people$ neither he nor his subjects know anything of weapons$ and go naked$ as I have said$ and they are the most timorous people in the world. The few people left there are sufficient to conquer the country$ and the island would thus remain without danger to them$ they keeping order among themselves.
Bristol,Bristol $ United Kingdom,-2.58791,51.454513,After sailing west two thousand leagues Cabot found land in the neighbourhood of Cape Breton$ and was thus in all probability the first discoverer$ since the Icelanders$ of the mainland of the New World. He turned northward$ sailed through the strait of Belle Isle$ and came home again$ having accomplished his task in three months. Cabot$ like Columbus$ believed he had seen the territory of the Great Khan$ of whom he told the interested population of Bristol some strange things. He further told them of the probable riches of this new land if it were followed in a southerly direction; told them some lies also$ it appears$ since he said that the waters there were so dense with fish that his vessels could hardly move in them. He received a gratuity of L10 and a pension$ and made a great sensation in Bristol by walking about the city dressed in fine silk garments. He took other voyages also with his son Sebastian$ who followed with him the rapid widening stream of discovery and became Pilot Major of Spain$ and President of the Congress appointed in 1524 to settle the conflicting pretensions of various discoverers; but so far as our narrative is concerned$ having sailed across from Bristol and discovered the mainland of the New World some years before Columbus discovered it$ John Cabot sails into oblivion.
Midas,Olathe $ United States,-94.78467789999999,38.8841201,So much for the outposts of the Old World. Of the New World$ about the possibility of which Columbus is beginning to dream as he sails the Mediterranean$ there was no knowledge and hardly any thought. Though new in the thoughts of Columbus$ it was very old in itself; generations of men had lived and walked and spoken and toiled there$ ever since men came upon the earth; sun and shower$ the thrill of the seasons$ birth and life and death$ had been visiting it for centuries and centuries. And it is quite possible that$ long before even the civilisation that produced Columbus was in its dawn$ men from the Old World had journeyed there. There are two very old fragments of knowledge which indicate at least the possibility of a Western World of which the ancients had knowledge. There is a fragment$ preserved from the fourth century before Christ$ of a conversation between Silenus and Midas$ King of Phrygia$ in which Silenus correctly describes the Old WorldEurope$ Asia$ and Africaas being surrounded by the sea$ but also describes$ far to the west of it$ a huge island$ which had its own civilisation and its own laws$ where the animals and the men were of twice our stature$ and lived for twice our years. There is also the story told by Plato of the island of Atlantis$ which was larger than Africa and Asia together$ and which in an earthquake disappeared beneath the waves$ producing such a slime upon the surface that no ship was able to navigate the sea in that place. This is the story which the priests of Sais told to Solon$ and which was embodied in the sacred inscriptions in their temples. It is strange that any one should think of this theory of the slime who had not seen or heard of the Sargasso Seathat great bank of floating seaweed that the ocean currents collect and retain in the middle of the basin of the North Atlantic.
Persia,Iran,53.688046,32.427908,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Matanza,Albuquerque $ United States,-106.6086603,35.0806638,The two forces met near the present town of Santiago$ in the plain known as the Savanna of Matanza. The Spanish force was divided into three main divisions$ under the command of Christopher and Bartholomew Columbus and Ojeda respectively. These three divisions attacked the Indians simultaneously from different points$ Ojeda throwing his cavalry upon them$ riding them down$ and cutting them to pieces. Drums were beaten and trumpets blown; the guns were fired from the cover of the trees; and a pack of bloodhounds$ which had been sent out from Spain with Bartholomew$ were let loose upon the natives and tore their bodies to pieces. It was an easy and horrible victory. The native force was estimated by Columbus at one hundred thousand men$ although we shall probably be nearer the mark if we reduce that estimate by one half.
Gloria,San Antonio $ United States,-98.4811904,29.4442691,Although the journey from Jamaica to Espanola had been accomplished in four days by Mendez in his canoe$ the caravels conveying the party rescued from Puerto Santa Gloria were seven weary weeks on this short voyage; a strong north-west wind combining with the west-going current to make their progress to the north-west impossible for weeks at a time. It was not until the 13th of August 1503 that they anchored in the harbour of San Domingo$ and Columbus once more set foot$ after an absence of more than two years$ on the territory from the governorship of which he had been deposed.
Isola,San Diego $ United States,-117.168553,32.721204,It is another illustration of the way in which discovery and imagination had hitherto gone by steps and not by flights$ that geographical knowledge reached the islands of the Atlantic (none of which were at a very great distance from the coast of Europe or from each other) at a comparatively early date$ and stopped there until in Columbus there was found a man with faith strong enough to make the long flight beyond them to the unknown West. And yet the philosophers$ and later the cartographers$ true to their instinct for this pedestrian kind of imagination$ put mythical lands and islands to the westward of the known islands as though they were really trying to make a way$ to sink stepping stones into the deep sea that would lead their thoughts across the unknown space. In the Catalan map of the world$ which was the standard example of cosmography in the early days of Columbus$ most of these mythical islands are marked. There was the island of Antilia$ which was placed in 25 deg. 35 W.$ and was said to have been discovered by Don Roderick$ the last of the Gothic kings of Spain$ who fled there after his defeat by the Moors. There was the island of the Seven Cities$ which is sometimes identified with this Antilia$ and was the object of a persistent belief or superstition on the part of the inhabitants of the Canary Islands. They saw$ or thought they saw$ about ninety leagues to the westward$ an island with high peaks and deep valleys. The vision was intermittent; it was only seen in very clear weather$ on some of those pure$ serene days of the tropics when in the clear atmosphere distant objects appear to be close at hand. In cloudy$ and often in clear weather also$ it was not to be seen at all; but the inhabitants of the Canaries$ who always saw it in the same place$ were so convinced of its reality that they petitioned the King of Portugal to allow them to go and take possession of it; and several expeditions were in fact despatched$ but none ever came up with that fairy land. It was called the island of the Seven Cities from a legend of seven bishops who had fled from Spain at the time of the Moorish conquest$ and$ landing upon this island$ had founded there seven splendid cities. There was the island of St. Brandan$ called after the Saint who set out from Ireland in the sixth century in search of an island which always receded before his ships; this island was placed several hundred miles to the west of the Canaries on maps and charts through out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was the island of Brazil$ to the west of Cape St. Vincent; the islands of Royllo$ San Giorgio$ and Isola di Mam; but they were all islands of dreams$ seen by the eyes of many mariners in that imaginative time$ but never trodden by any foot of man. To Columbus$ however$ and the mariners of his day$ they were all real places$ which a man might reach by special good fortune or heroism$ but which$ all things considered$ it was not quite worth the while of any man to attempt to reach. They have all disappeared from our charts$ like the Atlantis of Plato$ that was once charted to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar$ and of which the Canaries were believed to be the last peaks unsubmerged.

There was the island of the Seven Cities$ which is sometimes identified with this Antilia$ and was the object of a persistent belief or superstition on the part of the inhabitants of the Canary Islands. They saw$ or thought they saw$ about ninety leagues to the westward$ an island with high peaks and deep valleys. The vision was intermittent; it was only seen in very clear weather$ on some of those pure$ serene days of the tropics when in the clear atmosphere distant objects appear to be close at hand. In cloudy$ and often in clear weather also$ it was not to be seen at all; but the inhabitants of the Canaries$ who always saw it in the same place$ were so convinced of its reality that they petitioned the King of Portugal to allow them to go and take possession of it; and several expeditions were in fact despatched$ but none ever came up with that fairy land. It was called the island of the Seven Cities from a legend of seven bishops who had fled from Spain at the time of the Moorish conquest$ and$ landing upon this island$ had founded there seven splendid cities. There was the island of St. Brandan$ called after the Saint who set out from Ireland in the sixth century in search of an island which always receded before his ships; this island was placed several hundred miles to the west of the Canaries on maps and charts through out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was the island of Brazil$ to the west of Cape St. Vincent; the islands of Royllo$ San Giorgio$ and Isola di Mam; but they were all islands of dreams$ seen by the eyes of many mariners in that imaginative time$ but never trodden by any foot of man. To Columbus$ however$ and the mariners of his day$ they were all real places$ which a man might reach by special good fortune or heroism$ but which$ all things considered$ it was not quite worth the while of any man to attempt to reach. They have all disappeared from our charts$ like the Atlantis of Plato$ that was once charted to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar$ and of which the Canaries were believed to be the last peaks unsubmerged.
Middle,Altoona $ United States,-95.6613696,37.5239434,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Rome,Rome $ Italy,12.4963655,41.9027835, In the month of May the Admiral was well enough at last to undertake the journey to Segovia. He travelled on a mule$ and was accompanied by his brother Bartholomew and his son Ferdinand. When he reached the Court he found the King civil and outwardly attentive to his recitals$ but apparently content with a show of civility and outward attention. Columbus was becoming really a nuisance; that is the melancholy truth. The King had his own affairs to attend to; he was already meditating a second marriage$ and thinking of the young bride he was to bring home to the vacant place of Isabella; and the very iteration of Columbuss complaints and demands had made them lose all significance for the King. He waved them aside with polite and empty promises$ as people do the demands of importunate children; and finally$ to appease the Admiral and to get rid of the intolerable nuisance of his applications$ he referred the whole question$ first to Archbishop DEA$ and then to the body of councillors which had been appointed to interpret Queen Isabellas will. The whole question at issue was whether or not the original agreement with Columbus$ which had been made before his discoveries$ should be carried out. The King$ who had foolishly subscribed to it simply as a matter of form$ never believing that anything much could come of it$ was determined that it should not be carried out$ as it would give Columbus a wealth and power to which no mere subject of a crown was entitled. The Admiral held fast to his privileges; the only thing that he would consent to submit to arbitration was the question of his revenues; but his titles and territorial authorities he absolutely stuck to. Of course the council did exactly what the King had done. They talked about the thing a great deal$ but they did nothing. Columbus was an invalid and broken man$ who might die any day$ and it was obviously to their interest to gain time by discussion and delaya cruel game for our Christopher$ who knew his days on earth to be numbered$ and who struggled in that web of time in which mortals try to hurry the events of the present and delay the events of the future. Meanwhile Philip of Austria and his wife Juana$ Isabellas daughter$ had arrived from Flanders to assume the crown of Castile$ which Isabella had bequeathed to them. Columbus saw a chance for himself in this coming change$ and he sent Bartholomew as an envoy to greet the new Sovereigns$ and to enlist their services on the Admirals behalf. Bartholomew was very well received$ but he was too late to be of use to the Admiral$ whom he never saw again; and this is our farewell to Bartholomew$ who passes out of our narrative here. He went to Rome after Christophers death on a mission to the Pope concerning some fresh voyages of discovery; and in 1508 he made$ so far as we know$ his one excursion into romance$ when he assisted at the production of an illegitimate little girlhis only descendant. He returned to Espanola under the governorship of his nephew Diego$ and died there in 1514stern$ valiant$ brotherly soul$ whose devotion to Christopher must be for ever remembered and honoured with the name of the Admiral.
Colombo,Colombo $ Sri Lanka,79.861243,6.9270786,He had been at sea for ten or eleven years$ making voyages to and from Genoa$ with an occasional spell ashore and plunge into the paternal affairs$ when in the year 1476 he found himself on board a Genoese vessel which formed one of a convoy going$ to Lisbon. This convoy was attacked off Cape St. Vincent by Colombo$ or Colomb$ the famous French corsair$ of whom Christopher himself has quite falsely been called a relative. Only two of the Genoese vessels escaped$ and one of these two was the ship which carried Columbus. It arrived at Lisbon$ where Columbus went ashore and took up his abode.
Greece,Greece,21.824312,39.074208,In conclusion$ referring only to what has been effected by this voyage$ which was made with so much haste$ Your Highnesses may see that I shall find as much gold as desired with the very little assistance afforded to me; there is as much spice and cotton as can be wished for$ and also gum$ which hitherto has only been found in Greece$ in the island of Chios$ and they may sell it as they please$ and the mastich$ as much as may be desired$ and slaves$ also$ who will be idolators. And I believe that I have rhubarb$ and cinnamon$ and a thousand other things I shall find$ which will be discovered by those whom I have left behind$ for I did not stop at any cape when the wind enabled me to navigate$ except at the town of Navidad$ where I was very safe and well taken care of. And in truth much more I should have done if the ships had served me as might have been expected. This is certain$ that the Eternal God our Lord gives all things to those who obey Him$ and the victory when it seems impossible$ and this$ evidently$ is an instance of it$ for although people have talked of these lands$ all was conjecture unless proved by seeing them$ for the greater part listened and judged more by hearsay than by anything else.
Jerusalem,Jerusalem $ Israel,35.21371,31.768319,The afternoon was spent in deciding on a site for the fortress which was to be constructed; and Columbus had no difficulty in finding volunteers among the crews to remain in the settlement. He promised to leave with them provisions of bread and wine for a year$ a ships boat$ seeds for sowing crops$ and a carpenter$ a caulker$ a gunner$ and a cooper. Before the day was out he was already figuring up the profit that would arise out of his misfortune of the day before; and he decided that it was the act of God which had cast his ship away in order that this settlement should be founded. He hoped that the settlers would have a ton of gold ready for him when he came back from Castile$ so that$ as he had said in the glittering camp of Santa Fe$ where perhaps no one paid very much heed to him$ there might be such a profit as would provide for the conquest of Jerusalem and the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. After all$ if he was greedy for gold$ he had a pious purpose for its employment.
Norwich,Northfield $ United States,-72.6612317,44.13900539999999,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Gibralter,Gibraltar,-5.353585,36.140751,I have already said that I went 107 leagues along the coast of Juana$ from east to west. Thus$ according to my track$ it is larger than England and Scotland together$ for$ besides these 107 leagues$ there were further west two provinces to which I did not go$ one of which is called Cibau$ the people of which are born with tails; which provinces must be about fifty or sixty leagues long$ according to what I can make out from the Indians I have with me$ who know all the islands. The other island (Espanola) is larger in circuit than the whole of Spain$ from the Straits of Gibralter (the Columns) to Fuentarabia in Biscay$ as I sailed 138 long leagues in a direct line from west to east. Once known it must be desired$ and once seen one desires never to leave it; and which$ being taken possession of for their Highnesses$ and the people being at present in a condition lower than I can possibly describe$ the Sovereigns of Castile may dispose of it in any manner they please in the most convenient places. In this Espanola$ and in the best district$ where are gold mines$ and$ on the other side$ from thence to terra firma$ as well as from thence to the Great Khan$ where everything is on a splendid scaleI have taken possession of a large town$ to which I gave the name of La Navidad$ and have built a fort in it$ in every respect complete. And I have left sufficient people in it to take care of it$ with artillery and provisions for more than a year; also a boat and coxswain with the equipments$ in complete friendship with the King of the islands$ to that degree that he delighted to call me and look on me as his brother. And should they fall out with these people$ neither he nor his subjects know anything of weapons$ and go naked$ as I have said$ and they are the most timorous people in the world. The few people left there are sufficient to conquer the country$ and the island would thus remain without danger to them$ they keeping order among themselves.
Winchelsea,Winchelsea $ United Kingdom,0.7095541,50.92497210000001,Three vessels were at last secured. The first$ named the Santa Maria$ was the largest$ and was chosen to be the flagship of Columbus. She was of about one hundred tons burden$ and would be about ninety feet in length by twenty feet beam. She was decked over$ and had a high poop astern and a high forecastle in the bows. She had three masts$ two of them square-rigged$ with a latine sail on the mizzen mast; and she carried a crew of fifty-two persons. Where and how they all stowed themselves away is a matter upon which we can only make wondering guesses; for this ship was about the size of an ordinary small coasting schooner$ such as is worked about the coasts of these islands with a crew of six or eight men. The next largest ship was the Pinta$ which was commanded by Martin Alonso Pinzon$ who took his brother Francisco with him as sailing-master. The Pinta was of fifty tons burden$ decked only at the bow and stern$ and the fastest of the three ships; she also had three masts. The third ship was a caravel of forty tons and called the Nina; she belonged to Juan Nino of Palos. She was commanded by Vincenti Pinzon$ and had a complement of eighteen men. Among the crew of the flagship$ whose names and places of residence are to be found in the Appendix$ were an Englishman and an Irishman. The Englishman is entered as Tallarte de Lajes (Ingles)$ who has been ingeniously identified with a possible Allard or AEthelwald of Winchelsea$ there having been several generations of Allards who were sailors of Winchelsea in the fifteenth century. Sir Clements Markham thinks that this Allard may have been trading to Coruna and have married and settled down at Lajes. There is also Guillermo Ires$ an Irishman from Galway.
Domenico,Cranberry Township $ United States,-80.1040223,40.7015724,And besides the weaving of wool and pouring of wine and buying and selling of land$ there were more human occupations$ which Domenico was not the man to neglect. He had married$ about the year 1450$ one Susanna$ a daughter of Giacomo of Fontana-Rossa$ a silk weaver who lived in the hamlet near to Terra-Rossa. Domenicos father was of the more consequence of the two$ for he had$ as well as his home in the valley$ a house at Quinto$ where he probably kept a felucca for purposes of trade with Alexandria and the Islands. Perhaps the young people were married at Quinto$ but if so they did not live there long$ moving soon into Genoa$ where Domenico could more conveniently work at his trade. The wool-weavers at that time lived in a quarter outside the old city walls$ between them and the outer borders of the city$ which is now occupied by the park and public gardens. Here they had their dwellings and workshops$ their schools and institutions$ receiving every protection and encouragement from the Signoria$ who recognised the importance of the wool trade and its allied industries to Genoa. Cloth-weavers$ blanket-makers$ silk-weavers$ and velvet-makers all lived in this quarter$ and held their houses under the neighbouring abbey of San Stefano. There are two houses mentioned in documents which seem to have been in the possession of Domenico at different times. One was in the suburbs outside the Olive Gate; the other was farther in$ by St. Andrews Gate$ and quite near to the sea. The house outside the Olive Gate has disappeared; and it was probably here that our Christopher first saw the light$ and pleased Domenicos heart with his little cries and struggles. Neither the day nor even the year is certainly known$ but there is most reason to believe that it was in the year 1451. They must have moved soon afterwards to the house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello$ No. 37$ in which most of Christophers childhood was certainly passed. This is a house close to St. Andrews Gate$ which gate still stands in a beautiful and ruinous condition.
Gomera,La Gomera$ Santa Cruz de Tenerife$ Spain,-17.2193578,28.1033035,Columbus was at sea again; firm ground to him$ although so treacherous and unstable to most of us; and as he saw the Spanish coast sinking down on the horizon he could shake himself free from his troubles$ and feel that once more he was in a situation of which he was master. He first touched at Porto Santo$ where$ if the story of his residence there be true$ there must have been potent memories for him in the sight of the long white beach and the plantations$ with the Governors house beyond. He stayed there only a few hours and then crossed over to Madeira$ anchoring in the Bay of Funchal$ where he took in wood and water. As it was really unnecessary for him to make a port so soon after leaving$ there was probably some other reason for his visit to these islands; perhaps a family reason; perhaps nothing more historically important than the desire to look once more on scenes of bygone happiness$ for even on the page of history every event is not necessarily big with significance. From Madeira he took a southerly course to the Canary Islands$ and on June 16th anchored at Gomera$ where he found a French warship with two Spanish prizes$ all of which put to sea as the Admirals fleet approached. On June 21st$ when he sailed from Gomera$ he divided his fleet of six vessels into two squadrons. Three ships were despatched direct to Espanola$ for the supplies which they carried were urgently needed there. These three ships were commanded by trustworthy men: Pedro de Arana$ a brother of Beatriz$ Alonso Sanchez de Carvajal$ and Juan Antonio Colombothis last no other than a cousin of Christophers from Genoa. The sons of Domenicos provident younger brother had not prospered$ while the sons of improvident Domenico were now all in high places; and these three poor cousins$ hearing of Christophers greatness$ and deciding that use should be made of him$ scraped together enough money to send one of their number to Spain. The Admiral always had a sound family feeling$ and finding that cousin Antonio had sea experience and knew how to handle a ship he gave him command of one of the caravels on this voyagea command of which he proved capable and worthy. From these three captains$ after giving them full sailing directions for reaching Espanola$ Columbus parted company off the island of Ferro. He himself stood on a southerly course towards the Cape Verde Islands.
PORTUGAL,Portugal,-8.224454,39.39987199999999,CHAPTER VI. IN PORTUGAL
Moclin,Moclín $ Spain,-3.7860562,37.3403656,It was not the happiest moment$ indeed$ in which to talk of ships and charts$ and lonely sea-roads$ and faraway undiscovered shores. Things at home were very real and lively in those spring days at Cordova. The war against the Moors had reached a critical stage; King Ferdinand was away laying siege to the city of Loxa$ and though the Queen was at Cordova she was entirely occupied with the business of collecting and forwarding troops and supplies to his aid. The streets were full of soldiers; nobles and grandees from all over the country were arriving daily with their retinues; glitter and splendour$ and the pomp of warlike preparation$ filled the city. Early in June the Queen herself went to the front and joined her husband in the siege of Moclin; and when this was victoriously ended$ and they had returned in triumph to Cordova$ they had to set out again for Gallicia to suppress a rebellion there. When that was over they did not come back to Cordova at all$ but repaired at once to Salamanca to spend the winter there.
Hojeda,Sevilla $ Spain,-5.9611144,37.384549,This Adrian$ as it appears$ had sent Don Ferdinand to Xaragua to collect some of his followers$ and there a dispute arose with the Alcalde from which a deadly contest ensued$ and he [Adrian] did not effect his purpose. The Alcalde seized him and a part of his band$ and the fact was that he would have executed them if I had not prevented it; they were kept prisoners awaiting a caravel in which they might depart. The news of Hojeda which I told them made them lose the hope that he would now come again.
Lorenzo,Irvine $ United States,-117.8198472,33.67712470000001,Late on Thursday night$ when he anchored again in the harbour of San Lorenzo at Santa Maria$ a man hailed them from the rocks$ and asked them not to go away. Presently a boat containing five sailors$ two priests$ and a notary put off from the beach; and they asked for a guarantee of security in order that they might treat with the Admiral. They slept on board that night$ and in the morning asked him to show them his authority from the Spanish Sovereigns$ which the Admiral did$ understanding that they had asked for this formality in order to save their dignity. He showed them his general letter from the King and Queen of Spain$ addressed to Princes and Lords of High Degree; and being satisfied with this they went ashore and released the Admirals people$ from whom he learned that what had been done had been done by command of the King of Portugal$ and that he had issued an order to the Governors of all the Portuguese islands that if Columbus landed there on his way home he was to be taken prisoner.
Dixon,Dixon $ United States,-121.8232958,38.4454641,There are no paths or footprints left in the sea$ and the water furrowed on that morning more than four hundred years ago by the keels of Columbuss little fleet is as smooth and trackless as it was before they clove it. Yet if you approach Guanahani from the east during the hours of darkness you also will see a light that waxes and wanes on the horizon. What the light was that Columbus saw is not certain; it was probably the light from a torch held by some native woman from the door of her hut; but the light that you will see is from the lighthouse on Dixon Hill$ where a tower of coral holds a lamp one hundred and sixty feet above the sea at the north-east point of the island. It was erected in no sentimental spirit$ but for very practical purposes$ and at a date when Watlings Island had not been identified with the Guanahani of Columbuss landfall; and yet of all the monuments that have been raised to him I can think of nothing more appropriate than this lonely tower that stands by day amid the bright sunshine in the track of the trade wind$ and by night throws its powerful double flash every half-minute across the dark lonely sea. For it was by a light$ although not of mans kindling$ that Columbus was guided upon his lonely voyage and through his many difficulties; amid all his trials and disappointments$ dimly as it must have burned sometimes$ it never quite went out. Darkness was the name of the sea across which he took his way; darkness$ from his religious point of view$ was the state of the lands to which he journeyed; and$ whatever its subsequent worth may have been$ it was a burning fragment from the living torch of the Christian religion that he carried across the world with him$ and by which he sought to kindle the fire of faith in the lands of his discovery. So that there is a profound symbolism in those raying beams that now$ night after night$ month by month$ and year after year$ shine out across the sea from Watlings Island in the direction of the Old World.
Greenwich,Greenwich$ London SE10 9NN$ UK,-0.0076589,51.48257659999999,The second voyage of Columbus$ profoundly interesting as it must have been to him and to the numerous company to whom these waters were a strange and new region$ has not the romantic interest for us that his first voyage had. To the faith that guided him on his first venture knowledge and certainty had now been added; he was going by a familiar road; for to the mariner a road that he has once followed is a road that he knows. As a matter of fact$ however$ this second voyage was a far greater test of Columbuss skill as a navigator than the first voyage had been. If his navigation had been more haphazard he might never have found again the islands of his first discovery; and the fact that he made a landfall exactly where he wished to make it shows a high degree of exactness in his method of ascertaining latitude$ and is another instance of his skill in estimating his dead-reckoning. If he had been equipped with a modern quadrant and Greenwich chronometers he could not have made a quicker voyage nor a more exact landfall.
Zaragoza,Zaragoza $ Spain,-0.8890853,41.6488226,Thus passed the summer and autumn of 1487; precious months$ precious years slipping by$ and the great purpose as yet unfulfilled and seemingly no nearer to fulfilment. It is likely that Columbus kept up his applications to the Court$ and received polite and delaying replies. The next year came$ and the Court migrated from Zaragoza to Murcia$ from Murcia to Valladolid$ from Valladolid to Medina del Campo. Columbus attended it in one or other of these places$ but without result. In August Beatriz gave birth to a son$ who was christened Ferdinand$ and who lived to be a great comfort to his father$ if not to her also. But the miracle of paternity was not now so new and wonderful as it had been; the battle of life$ with its crosses and difficulties$ was thick about him; and perhaps he looked into this new-comers small face with conflicting thoughts$ and memories of the long white beach and the crashing surf at Porto Santo$ and regret for things lostso strangely mingled and inconsistent are the threads of human thought. At last he decided to turn his face elsewhere. In September 1488 he went to Lisbon$ for what purpose it is not certain; possibly in connection with the affairs of his dead wife; and probably also in the expectation of seeing his brother Bartholomew$ to whom we may now turn our attention for a moment.
Cotabanama,Higüey $ Dominican Republic,-68.7120465,18.6065151,The fifth chief$ Cotabanama$ Lord of the province of Higua$ made the last stand against Ovando in defence of the native right to existence$ and was only defeated after severe battles and dreadful slaughters. His territory was among the mountains$ and his last insurrection was caused$ as so many others had been$ by the intolerable conduct of the Spaniards towards the wives and daughters of the Indians. Collecting all his warriors$ Cotabanama attacked the Spanish posts in his neighbourhood. At every engagement his troops were defeated and dispersed$ but only to collect again$ fight again with even greater fury$ be defeated and dispersed again$ and rally again against the Spaniards. They literally fought to the death. After every battle the Spaniards made a massacre of all the natives they could find$ old men$ children$ and pregnant women being alike put to the sword or burned in their houses. When their companions fell beside them$ instead of being frightened they became more furious; and when they were wounded they would pluck the arrows out of their bodies and hurl them back at the Spaniards$ falling dead in the very act. After one such severe defeat and massacre the natives scattered for many months$ hiding among the mountains and trying to collect and succour their decimated families; but the Spaniards$ who with their dogs grew skilful at tracking the Indians and found it pleasant sport$ came upon them in the places of refuge where little groups of them were sheltering their women and children$ and there slowly and cruelly slaughtered them$ often with the addition of tortures and torments in order to induce them to reveal the whereabouts of other bands. When it was possible the Spaniards sometimes hanged thirteen of them in a row in commemoration of their Blessed Saviour and the Twelve Apostles; and while they were hanging$ and before they had quite died$ they would hack at them with their swords in order to test the edge of the steel. At the last stand$ when the fierceness and bitterness of the contest rose to a height on both sides$ Cotabanama was captured and a plan made to broil him slowly to death; but for some reason this plan was not carried out$ and the brave chief was taken to San Domingo and publicly hanged like a thief.
Paraiso,La Mirada $ United States,-118.035705,33.916453,On the Friday a messenger came from the King in the person of Don Martin de Noronha$ a relative of Columbus by marriage$ and one who had perhaps looked down upon him in the days when he attended the convent chapel at Lisbon$ but who was now the bearer of a royal invitation and in the position of a mere envoy. Columbus repaired to Paraiso where the King was$ and where he was received with great honour.
Verde,Irving $ United States,-96.9374443,32.9018662,He stayed for about a week at the Cape Verde Islands$ getting in provisions and cattle$ and curiously observing the life of the Portuguese lepers who came in numbers to the island of Buenavista to be cured there by eating the flesh and bathing in the blood of turtles. It was not an inspiriting week which he spent in that dreary place and enervating climate$ with nothing to see but the goats feeding among the scrub$ the turtles crawling about the sand$ and the lepers following the turtles. It began to tell on the health of the crew$ so he weighed anchor on July 5th and stood on a southwesterly course.
Duomo,Firenze $ Italy,11.2559602,43.773145,Here$ then$ between the narrow little house by the Gate and the clamour and business of the sea-front$ our Christophers feet carried him daily during some part of his childish life. What else he did$ what he thought and felt$ what little reflections he had$ are but matters of conjecture. Genoa will tell you nothing more. You may walk over the very spot where he was born; you may unconsciously tread in the track of his vanished feet; you may wander about the wharves of the city$ and see the ships loading and unloadingdifferent ships$ but still trafficking in commodities not greatly different from those of his day; you may climb the heights behind Genoa$ and look out upon the great curving Gulf from Porto Fino to where the Cape of the western Riviera dips into the sea; you may walk along the coast to Savona$ where Domenico had one of his many habitations$ where he kept the tavern$ and whither Christophers young feet must also have walked; and you may come back and search again in the harbour$ from the old Mole and the Bank of St. George to where the port and quays stretch away to the medley of sailing-ships and steamers; but you will not find any sign or trace of Christopher. No echo of the little voice that shrilled in the narrow street sounds in the Vico Dritto; the houses stand gaunt and straight$ with a brilliant strip of blue sky between their roofs and the cool street beneath; but they give you nothing of what you seek. If you see a little figure running towards you in a blue smock$ the head fair-haired$ the face blue-eyed and a little freckled with the strong sunshine$ it is not a real figure; it is a child of your dreams and a ghost of the past. You may chase him while he runs about the wharves and stumbles over the ropes$ but you will never catch him. He runs before you$ zigzagging over the cobbles$ up the sunny street$ into the narrow house; out again$ running now towards the Duomo$ hiding in the porch of San Stefano$ where the weavers held their meetings; back again along the wharves; surely he is hiding behind that mooring-post! But you look$ and he is not therenothing but the old harbour dust that the wind stirs into a little eddy while you look.

Olive,Daytona Beach $ United States,-81.0658369,29.1938295,In 1450 he bought a pleasant house at Quarto$ a village on the sea-shore about a mile to the west of Quinto and about five miles to the east of Genoa. It was probably a pure speculation$ as he immediately leased the house for two years$ and never lived in it himself$ although it was a pleasant place$ with an orchard of olives and figs and various other treesarboratum olivis ficubus et aliis diversis arboribus. His next recorded transaction is in 1466$ when he went security for a friend$ doubtless with disastrous results. In 1473 he sold the house at the Olive Gate$ that suburban dwelling where probably Christopher was born$ and in 1474 he invested the proceeds of that sale in a piece of land which I have referred to before$ situated in the suburbs of Savona$ with which were sold those agreeable and useless wine-vats. Domenico was living at Savona then$ and the property which he so fatuously acquired consisted of two large pieces of land on the Via Valcalda$ containing a few vines$ a plantation of fruit-trees$ and a large area of shrub and underwood. The price$ however$ was never paid in full$ and was the cause of a lawsuit which dragged on for forty years$ and was finally settled by Don Diego Columbus$ Christophers son$ who sent a special authority from Hispaniola.

What we do find$ however$ is that the inner light that had led him across the seas never burned clearly for him again$ and was never his guide in the later part of his life. Its radiance was quenched by the gleam of gold; for there is no doubt that Columbus was a victim of that baleful influence which has caused so much misery in this world. He was greedy of gold for himself undoubtedly; but he was still more greedy of it for Spain. It was his ambition to be the means of filling the coffers of the Spanish Sovereigns and so acquiring immense dignity and glory for himself. He believed that gold was in itself a very precious and estimable thing; he knew that masses and candles could be bought for it$ and very real spiritual privileges; and as he made blunder after blunder$ and saw evil after evil heaping itself on his record in the New World$ he became the more eager and frantic to acquire such a treasure of gold that it would wipe out the other evils of his administration.

Philip,Philip $ United States,-101.6651441,44.0394329,Some time after this letter was written$ and before the writing of the next$ news reached Seville of the death of Queen Isabella. For ten years her kind heart had been wrung by many sorrows. Her mother had died in 1496; the next year her only son and heir to the crown had followed; and within yet another year had died her favourite daughter$ the Queen of Portugal. Her other children were all scattered with the exception of Juana$ whose semi-imbecile condition caused her parents an anxiety greater even than that caused by death. As Isabellas life thus closed sombrely in$ she applied herself more closely and more narrowly to such pious consolations as were available. News from Flanders of the scandalous scenes between Philip and Juana in the summer of 1504 brought on an illness from which she really never recovered$ a kind of feverish distress of mind and body in which her only alleviation was the transaction of such business as was possible for her in the direction of humanity and enlightenment. She still received men of intellect and renown$ especially travellers. But she knew that her end was near$ and as early as October she had made her will$ in which her wishes as to the succession and government of Castile were clearly laid down. There was no mention of Columbus in this will$ which afterwards greatly mortified him; but it is possible that the poor Queen had by this time$ even against her wish$ come to share the opinions of her advisers that the rule of Columbus in the West Indies had not brought the most humane and happy results possible to the people there.
Andalusia,Andalusia$ Spain,-4.7277528,37.5442706,Item. You will say to their Highnesses$ as has been said$ that the cause of the general sicknesses common to all is the change of water and air$ because we see that it extends to all conditions and few are in danger: consequently$ for the preservation of health$ after God$ it is necessary that these people be provided with the provisions to which they are accustomed in Spain$ because neither they$ nor others who may come anew$ will be able to serve their Highnesses if they are not well: and this provision must continue until a supply is accumulated here from what shall be sowed and planted here. I say wheat and barley$ and vines$ of which little has been done this year because a site for the town could not be selected before$ and then when it was selected the few labourers who were here became sick$ and they$ even though they had been well$ had so few and such lean and meagre beasts of burden$ that they were able to do but little: nevertheless$ they have sown something$ more in order to try the soil which appears very wonderful$ so that from it some relief may be hoped in our necessities. We are very sure$ as the result makes it apparent to us$ that in this country wheat as well as the vine will grow very well: but the fruit must be waited for$ which$ if it corresponds to the quickness with which the wheat grows and of some few vine-shoots which were planted$ certainly will not cause regret here for the productions of Andalusia or Sicily: neither is it different with the sugar-canes according to the manner in which some few that were planted have grown. For it is certain that the sight of the land of these islands$ as well of the mountains and sierras and waters as of the plains where there are rich rivers$ is so beautiful$ that no other land on which the sun shines can appear better or as beautiful.

Porto,Porto $ Portugal,-8.629105299999999,41.1579438,The fleet as usual made the Canary Islands$ where they arrived on the 20th of May$ and stopped for five days taking in wood and water and fresh provisions. Columbus was himself againalways more himself at sea than anywhere else; he was following a now familiar road that had no difficulties or dangers for him; and there is no record of the voyage out except that it was quick and prosperous$ with the trade wind blowing so steadily that from the time they left the Canaries until they made land twenty days later they had hardly to touch a sheet or a halliard. The first land they made was the island of Martinique$ where wood and water were taken in and the men sent ashore to wash their linen. To young Ferdinand$ but fourteen years old$ this voyage was like a fairy tale come true$ and his delight in everything that he saw must have added greatly to Christophers pleasure and interest in the voyage. They only stayed a few days at Martinique and then sailed westward along the chain of islands until they came to Porto Rico$ where they put in to the sunny harbour which they had discovered on a former voyage.
Nuremberg,Nuremberg $ Germany,11.0766654,49.4521018,The people who probably helped him most in this were his brother Bartholomew and Martin Behaim$ the great authority on scientific navigation$ who had been living in Lisbon for some time and with whom Columbus was acquainted. Behaim$ who was at this time about forty eight years of age$ was born at Nuremberg$ and was a pupil of Regiomontanus$ the great German astronomer. A very interesting man$ this$ if we could decipher his features and character; no mere star-gazing visionary$ but a man of the world$ whose scientific lore was combined with a wide and liberal experience of life. He was not only learned in cosmography and astronomy$ but he had a genius for mechanics and made beautiful instruments; he was a merchant also$ and combined a little business with his scientific travels. He had been employed at Lisbon in adapting the astrolabe of Regiomontanus for the use of sailors at sea; and in these labours he was assisted by two people who were destined to have a weighty influence on the career of ColumbusDoctors Rodrigo and Joseph$ physicians or advisers to the King$ and men of great academic reputation. There was nothing known about cosmography or astronomy that Behaim did not know; and he had just come back from an expedition on which he had been despatched$ with Rodrigo and Joseph$ to take the altitude of the sun in Guinea.
Scandinavia,Scandinavia,12.3401709,62.27864750000001,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Gallicia,Galicia$ Spain,-8.1338558,42.5750554,It was not the happiest moment$ indeed$ in which to talk of ships and charts$ and lonely sea-roads$ and faraway undiscovered shores. Things at home were very real and lively in those spring days at Cordova. The war against the Moors had reached a critical stage; King Ferdinand was away laying siege to the city of Loxa$ and though the Queen was at Cordova she was entirely occupied with the business of collecting and forwarding troops and supplies to his aid. The streets were full of soldiers; nobles and grandees from all over the country were arriving daily with their retinues; glitter and splendour$ and the pomp of warlike preparation$ filled the city. Early in June the Queen herself went to the front and joined her husband in the siege of Moclin; and when this was victoriously ended$ and they had returned in triumph to Cordova$ they had to set out again for Gallicia to suppress a rebellion there. When that was over they did not come back to Cordova at all$ but repaired at once to Salamanca to spend the winter there.

The other island (Espanola) is larger in circuit than the whole of Spain$ from the Straits of Gibralter (the Columns) to Fuentarabia in Biscay$ as I sailed 138 long leagues in a direct line from west to east.

Bay,Bay County$ FL$ USA,-85.684578,30.1805306,The coast of the mainland had thus been explored from the Bay of Honduras to Brazil$ and Columbus was obliged to admit that there was no strait. Having satisfied himself of that he decided to turn back to Veragua$ where he had seen the natives smelting gold$ in order to make some arrangement for establishing a colony there. The wind$ however$ which had headed him almost all the way on his easterly voyage$ headed him again now and began to blow steadily from the west. He started on his return journey on the 5th of December$ and immediately fell into almost worse troubles than he had been in before. The wood of the ships had been bored through and through by seaworms$ so that they leaked very badly; the crews were sick$ provisions were spoilt$ biscuits rotten. Young Ferdinand Columbus$ if he did not actually make notes of this voyage at the time$ preserved a very lively recollection of it$ and it is to his Historie$ which in its earlier passages is of doubtful authenticity$ that we owe some of the most human touches of description relating to this voyage. Any passage in his work relating to food or animals at this time has the true ring of boyish interest and observation$ and is in sharp contrast to the second-hand and artificial tone of the earlier chapters of his book. About the incident of the howling monkey$ which the Admirals Irish hound would not face$ Ferdinand remarks that it frighted a good dog that we had$ but frighted one of our wild boars a great deal more; and as to the condition of the biscuits when they turned westward again$ he says that they were so full of weevils that$ as God shall help me$ I saw many that stayed till night to eat their sop for fear of seeing them.
Greenland,Greenland,-42.604303,71.706936,The reasons for doubting that this voyage took place are due simply to Columbuss habit of being untruthful in regard to his own past doings$ and his propensity for drawing the long bow; and the reason that has been accepted by most of his biographers who have denied the truth of this statement is that$ in the year 1492$ when Columbus was addressing the King and Queen of Spain on his qualifications as a navigator$ and when he wished to set forth his experience in a formidable light$ he said nothing about this voyage$ but merely described his explorations as having extended from Guinea on the south to England on the north. A shrewd estimate of Columbuss character makes it indeed seem incredible that$ if he had really been in Iceland$ he should not have mentioned the fact on this occasion; and yet there is just one reason$ also quite characteristic of Columbus$ that would account for the suppression. It is just possible that when he was at Thule$ by which he meant Iceland$ he may have heard of the explorations in the direction of Greenland and Newfoundland; and that$ although by other navigators these lands were regarded as a part of the continent of Europe$ he may have had some glimmerings of an idea that they were part of land and islands in the West; and he was much too jealous of his own reputation as the great and only originator of the project for voyaging to the West$ to give away any hints that he was not the only person to whom such ideas had occurred. There is deception and untruth somewhere; and one must make ones choice between regarding the story in the first place as a lie$ or accepting it as truth$ and putting down Columbuss silence about it on a later occasion to a rare instinct of judicious suppression. There are other facts in his life$ to which$ we shall come later$ that are in accordance with this theory. There is no doubt$ moreover$ that Columbus had a very great experience of the sea$ and was one of the greatest practical seamen$ if not the greatest$ that has ever lived; and it would be foolish to deny$ except for the greatest reasons$ that he made a voyage to the far North$ which was neither unusual at the time nor a very great achievement for a seaman of his experience.

Huelva,Huelva $ Spain,-6.9447224,37.261421,But promise and performance$ as no one knew better than Columbus$ are different things; and it was a long while before he got his ships. There was the usual scarcity of money$ and the extensive military and diplomatic operations in which the Crown was then engaged absorbed every maravedi that Ferdinand could lay his hands on. There was an army to be maintained under the Pyrenees to keep watch over France; fleets had to be kept patrolling both the Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards; and there was a whole armada required to convey the princesses of Spain and Austria to their respective husbands in connection with the double matrimonial alliance arranged between the two countries. And when at last$ in October 1496$ six million maravedis were provided wherewith Columbus might equip his fleet$ they were withdrawn again under very mortifying circumstances. The appropriation had just been made when a letter arrived from Pedro Nino$ who had been to Espanola and come back again$ and now wrote from Cadiz to the Sovereigns$ saying that his ships were full of gold. He did not present himself at Court$ but went to visit his family at Huelva; but the good news of his letter was accepted as an excuse for this oversight.
Jamaica,Jamaica,-77.297508,18.109581,At the request of the Treasurer Morales$ I left two brothers in the Indies$ who are called Porras. The one was captain and the other auditor. Both were without capacity for these positions: and I was confident that they could fill them$ because of love for the person who sent them to me. They both became more vain than they had been. I forgave them many incivilities$ more than I would do with a relation$ and their offences were such that they merited another punishment than a verbal reprimand. Finally they reached such a point that even had I desired$ I could not have avoided doing what I did. The records of the case will prove whether I lie or not. They rebelled on the island of Jamaica$ at which I was as much astonished as I would be if the suns rays should cast darkness. I was at the point of death$ and they martyrised me with extreme cruelty during five months and without cause. Finally I took them all prisoners$ and immediately set them free$ except the captain$ whom I was bringing as a prisoner to their Highnesses. A petition which they made to me under oath$ and which I send you with this letter$ will inform you at length in regard to this matter$ although the records of the case explain it fully. These records and the Notary are coming on another vessel$ which I am expecting from day to day. The Governor in Santo Domingo took this prisoner.His courtesy constrained him to do this. I had a chapter in my instructions in which their Highnesses ordered all to obey me$ and that I should exercise civil and criminal justice over all those who were with me: but this was of no avail with the Governor$ who said that it was not understood as applying in his territory. He sent the prisoner to these Lords who have charge of the Indies without inquiry or record or writing. They did not receive him$ and both brothers go free. It is not wonderful to me that our Lord punishes. They went there with shameless faces. Such wickedness or such cruel treason were never heard of. I wrote to their Highnesses about this matter in the other letter$ and said that it was not right for them to consent to this offence. I also wrote to the Lord Treasurer that I begged him as a favour not to pass sentence on the testimony given by these men until he heard me. Now it will be well for you to remind him of it anew. I do$ not know how they dare to go before him with such an undertaking. I have written to him about it again and have sent him the copy of the oath$ the same as I send to you and likewise to Doctor Angulo and the Licentiate Zapata.

Alexandria,Alexandria $ Egypt,29.9187387,31.2000924,In this faith$ then$ and with this equipment$ and about the year 1465$ Christopher Columbus began his sea travels. His voyages would be doubtless at first much along the coasts$ and across to Alexandria and the Islands. There would be returnings to Genoa$ and glad welcomings by the little household in the narrow street; in 1472 and 1473 he was with his father at Savona$ helping with the wool-weaving and tavern-keeping; possibly also there were interviews with Benincasa$ who was at that time living in Genoa$ and making his famous sea-charts. Perhaps it was in his studio that Christopher first saw a chart$ and first fell in love with the magic that can transfer the shapes of oceans and continents to a piece of paper. Then he would be off again in another ship$ to the Golden Horn perhaps$ or the Black Sea$ for the Genoese had a great Crimean trade. This is all conjecture$ but very reasonable conjecture; what we know for a fact is that he saw the white gum drawn from the lentiscus shrubs in Chio at the time of their flowering; that fragrant memory is preserved long afterwards in his own writings$ evoked by some incident in the newly-discovered islands of the West. There are vague rumours and stories of his having been engaged in various expeditionsamong them one fitted out in Genoa by John of Anjou to recover the kingdom of Naples for King Rene of Provence; but there is no reason to believe these rumours: good reason to disbelieve them$ rather.
England,England$ UK,-1.1743197,52.3555177,A breath of salt air again will do us no harm as a relief from these perilous balancings of Columbus on the see-saw at Espanola. His true work in this world had indeed already been accomplished. When he smote the rock of western discovery many springs flowed from it$ and some were destined to run in mightier channels than that which he himself followed. Among other men stirred by the news of Columbuss first voyage there was one walking the streets of Bristol in 1496 who was fired to a similar enterprisea man of Venice$ in boyhood named Zuan Caboto$ but now known in England$ where he has some time been settled$ as Captain John Cabot. A sailor and trader who has travelled much through the known sea-roads of this world$ and has a desire to travel upon others not so well known. He has been in the East$ has seen the caravans of Mecca and the goods they carried$ and$ like Columbus$ has conceived in his mind the roundness of the world as a practical fact rather than a mere mathematical theory. Hearing of Columbuss success Cabot sets what machinery in England he has access to in motion to secure for him patents from King Henry VII.; which patents he receives on March 5$ 1496. After spending a long time in preparation$ and being perhaps a little delayed by diplomatic protests from the Spanish Ambassador in London$ he sails from Bristol in May 1497.

Providence,Providence $ United States,-71.4128343,41.8239891,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Navassa,Navassa Island,-75.0114612,18.4100689,Late in the night$ however$ the moon rose$ and Mendez had the joy of seeing its lower disc cut by a jagged line which proved to be the little islet or rock of Navassa$ which lies off the westerly end of Espanola. New hope now animated the sufferers$ and they pushed on until they were able to land on this rock$ which proved to be without any vegetation whatsoever$ but on the surface of which there were found some precious pools of rain-water. Mendez was able to restrain the frantic appetites of his fellow-countrymen$ but the savage companions were less wise$ and drank their fill; so that some of them died in torment on the spot$ and others became seriously ill. The Spaniards were able to make a fire of driftwood$ and boil some shell-fish$ which they found on shore$ and they wisely spent the heat of the day crouching in the shade of the rocks$ and put off their departure until the evening. It was then a comparatively easy journey for them to cross the dozen miles that separated them from Espanola$ and they landed the next day in a pleasant harbour near Cape Tiburon. Fieschi$ true to his promise$ was then ready to start back for Jamaica with news of the safe accomplishment of the voyage; but the remnant of the crews$ Spaniards and savage companions alike$ had had enough of it$ and no threats or persuasions would induce them to embark again. Mendez$ therefore$ left his friends to enjoy some little repose before continuing their journey to San Domingo$ and$ taking six natives of Espanola to row his canoe; set off along the coast towards the capital. He had not gone half-way when he learned that Ovando was not there$ but was in Xaragua$ so he left his canoe and struck northward through the forest until he arrived at the Governors camp.
India,India,78.96288,20.593684,And far worse things happened to them than labour and exhaustion. It became the custom among the Spaniards to regard the lives of the natives as of far less value than those of the dogs that were sometimes set upon them in sport. A Spaniard riding along would make a wager with his fellow that he would cut the head off a native with one stroke of his sword; and many attempts would be laughingly made$ and many living bodies hideously mutilated and destroyed$ before the feat would be accomplished. Another sport was one similar to pigsticking as it is practised in India$ except that instead of pigs native women and children were stuck with the lances. There was no kind of mutilation and monstrous cruelty that was not practised. If there be any powers of hell$ they stalked at large through the forests and valleys of Espanola. Lust and bloody cruelty$ of a kind not merely indescribable but unrealisable by sane men and women$ drenched the once happy island with anguish and terror. And in payment for it the Spaniards undertook to teach the heathen the Christian religion.
Seville,Seville $ Spain,-5.9844589,37.3890924, He was in his fifty-sixth year$ already an old man in body and mind; and his death went entirely unmarked except by his immediate circle of friends. Even Peter Martyr$ who was in Valladolid just before and just after it$ and who was writing a series of letters to various correspondents giving all the news of his day$ never thought it worth while to mention that Christopher Columbus was dead. His life flickered out in the completest obscurity. It is not even known where he was first buried; but probably it was in the Franciscan convent at Valladolid. This$ however$ was only a temporary resting-place; and a few years later his body was formally interred in the choir of the monastery of Las Cuevas at Seville$ there to lie for thirty years surrounded by continual chauntings. After that it was translated to the cathedral in San Domingo; rested there for 250 years$ and then$ on the cession of that part of the island to France$ the body was removed to Cuba. But the Admiral was by this time nothing but a box of bones and dust$ as also were brother Bartholomew and son Diego$ and Diegos son$ all collected together in that place. There were various examinations of the bone-boxes; one$ supposed to be the Admirals$ was taken to Cuba and solemnly buried there; and lately$ after the conquest of the island in the Spanish-American War$ this box of bones was elaborately conveyed to Seville$ where it now rests.
Orinoco,Orinoco,-65.0137314,5.4596193,Yet another of our old friends profited by the Admirals discovery. What Vincenti Yafiez Pinzon has been doing all these years we have no record; living at Palos$ perhaps$ doing a little of his ordinary coasting business$ administering the estates of his brother Martin Alonso$ and$ almost for a certainty$ talking pretty big about who it was that really did all the work in the discovery of the New World. Out of the obscurity of conjecture he emerges into fact in December 1499$ when he is found at Palos fitting out four caravels for the purpose of exploring farther along the coast of the southern mainland. That he also was after pearls is pretty certain; but on the other hand he was more of a sailor than an adventurer$ was a discoverer at heart$ and had no small share of the family taste for sea travel. He took a more southerly course than any of the others and struck the coast of America south of the equator on January 20$ 1500. He sailed north past the mouths of the Amazon and Orinoco through the Gulf of Paria$ and reached Espanola in June 1500. He only paused there to take in provisions$ and sailed to the west in search of further discoveries; but he lost two of his caravels in a gale and had to put back to Espanola.
Sancta,Gaylord $ United States,-84.7797115,45.0521353,He continued all day to sail slowly along the shore of the island$ the green luxuriance of which astonished him; and sometimes he stood out from the coast to the southward as he made a long board to round this or that point. It must have been while reaching out in this way to the southward that he saw a low shore on his port hand some sixty miles to the south of Trinidad$ and that his sight$ although he did not know it$ rested for the first time on the mainland of South America. The land seen was the low coast to the west of the Orinoco$ and thinking that it was an island he gave it the name of Isla Sancta.
London,London $ United Kingdom,-0.1277583,51.5073509,A breath of salt air again will do us no harm as a relief from these perilous balancings of Columbus on the see-saw at Espanola. His true work in this world had indeed already been accomplished. When he smote the rock of western discovery many springs flowed from it$ and some were destined to run in mightier channels than that which he himself followed. Among other men stirred by the news of Columbuss first voyage there was one walking the streets of Bristol in 1496 who was fired to a similar enterprisea man of Venice$ in boyhood named Zuan Caboto$ but now known in England$ where he has some time been settled$ as Captain John Cabot. A sailor and trader who has travelled much through the known sea-roads of this world$ and has a desire to travel upon others not so well known. He has been in the East$ has seen the caravans of Mecca and the goods they carried$ and$ like Columbus$ has conceived in his mind the roundness of the world as a practical fact rather than a mere mathematical theory. Hearing of Columbuss success Cabot sets what machinery in England he has access to in motion to secure for him patents from King Henry VII.; which patents he receives on March 5$ 1496. After spending a long time in preparation$ and being perhaps a little delayed by diplomatic protests from the Spanish Ambassador in London$ he sails from Bristol in May 1497.
Fino,San Francisco $ United States,-122.4122747,37.7878976,Here$ then$ between the narrow little house by the Gate and the clamour and business of the sea-front$ our Christophers feet carried him daily during some part of his childish life. What else he did$ what he thought and felt$ what little reflections he had$ are but matters of conjecture. Genoa will tell you nothing more. You may walk over the very spot where he was born; you may unconsciously tread in the track of his vanished feet; you may wander about the wharves of the city$ and see the ships loading and unloadingdifferent ships$ but still trafficking in commodities not greatly different from those of his day; you may climb the heights behind Genoa$ and look out upon the great curving Gulf from Porto Fino to where the Cape of the western Riviera dips into the sea; you may walk along the coast to Savona$ where Domenico had one of his many habitations$ where he kept the tavern$ and whither Christophers young feet must also have walked; and you may come back and search again in the harbour$ from the old Mole and the Bank of St. George to where the port and quays stretch away to the medley of sailing-ships and steamers; but you will not find any sign or trace of Christopher. No echo of the little voice that shrilled in the narrow street sounds in the Vico Dritto; the houses stand gaunt and straight$ with a brilliant strip of blue sky between their roofs and the cool street beneath; but they give you nothing of what you seek. If you see a little figure running towards you in a blue smock$ the head fair-haired$ the face blue-eyed and a little freckled with the strong sunshine$ it is not a real figure; it is a child of your dreams and a ghost of the past. You may chase him while he runs about the wharves and stumbles over the ropes$ but you will never catch him. He runs before you$ zigzagging over the cobbles$ up the sunny street$ into the narrow house; out again$ running now towards the Duomo$ hiding in the porch of San Stefano$ where the weavers held their meetings; back again along the wharves; surely he is hiding behind that mooring-post! But you look$ and he is not therenothing but the old harbour dust that the wind stirs into a little eddy while you look. For he belongs not to you or me$ this child; he is not yet enslaved to the great purpose$ not yet caught up into the machinery of life. His eye has not yet caught the fire of the sun setting on a western sea; he is still free and happy$ and belongs only to those who love him. Father and mother$ brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo$ sister Biancinetta$ aunts$ uncles$ and cousins possibly$ and possibly for a little while an old grandmother at Quintothese were the people to whom that child belonged. The little life of his first decade$ unviolated by documents or history$ lives happily in our dreams$ as blank as sunshine.
Maria,Bușteni $ Romania,25.5366039,45.4167308,The Admiral$ however$ was not to be so lonely a person as he had been on his first voyage; friends of his own choice and of a rank that made intimacy possible even with the Captain-General were to accompany him. There was James his brother; there was Friar Bernardo Buil$ a Benedictine monk chosen by the Pope to be his apostolic vicar in the New World; there was Alonso de Ojeda$ a handsome young aristocrat$ cousin to the Inquisitor of Spain$ who was distinguished for his dash and strength and pluck; an ideal adventurer$ the idol of his fellows$ and one of whose daring any number of credible and incredible tales were told. There was Pedro Margarite$ a well-born Aragonese$ who was destined afterwards to cause much trouble; there was Juan Ponce de Leon$ the discoverer of Florida; there was Juan de La Cosa$ Columbuss faithful pilot on the Santa Maria on his first voyage; there was Pedro de Las Casas$ whose son$ at this time a student in Seville$ was afterwards to become the historian of the New World and the champion of decency and humanity there. There was also Doctor Chanca$ a Court physician who accompanied the expedition not only in his professional capacity but also because his knowledge of botany would enable him to make$ a valuable report on the vegetables and fruits of the New World; there was Antonio de Marchena$ one of Columbuss oldest friends$ who went as astronomer to the expedition. And there was one Coma$ who would have remained unknown to this day but that he wrote an exceedingly elegant letter to his friend Nicolo Syllacio in Italy$ describing in flowery language the events of the second voyage; which letter$ and one written by Doctor Chanca$ are the only records of the outward voyage that exist. The journal kept by Columbus on this voyage has been lost$ and no copy of it remains.
Darien,Darien $ United States,-73.4686858,41.0771914,But he was not back in Espanola yet$ and his means for getting there were crumbling away beneath his feet. One of the three remaining caravels was entirely riddled by seaworms and had to be abandoned at the harbour called Puerto Bello; and the company was crowded on to two ships. The men now became more than ever discontented at the easterly course$ and on May 1st$ when he had come as far east as the Gulf of Darien$ Columbus felt obliged to bear away to the north$ although as it turned out he had not nearly made enough easting. He stood on this course$ for nine days$ the west-going current setting him down all the time; and the first land that he made$ on May 10th$ was the group of islands off the western end of Cuba which he had called the Queens Gardens.
Gulf,Persian Gulf (also known as the Arabian Gulf),51.6834275,26.7505337,But he was not back in Espanola yet$ and his means for getting there were crumbling away beneath his feet.

West,Oklahoma City $ United States,-97.5294917,35.5402333,The man himself was a simple man; capable$ when the whole of his various qualities were directed upon one single thing$ of that greatness which is the crown of simplicity. Ambition was the keynote of his life; not an unworthy keynote$ by any means$ if only the ambition be sound; but one serious defect of Columbuss ambition was that it was retrospective rather than perspective. He may have had$ before he sailed from Palos$ an ambition to be the discoverer of a New World; but I do not think he had. He believed there were islands or land to be discovered in the West if only he pushed on far enough; and he was ambitious to find them and vindicate his belief. Afterwards$ when he had read a little more$ and when he conceived the plan of pretending that he had all along meant to discover the Indies and a new road to the East$ he acted in accordance with that pretence; he tried to make his acts appear retrospectively as though they had been prompted by a design quite different from that by which they had really been prompted. When he found that his discovery was regarded as a great scientific feat$ he made haste to pretend that it had all along been meant as such$ and was in fact the outcome of an elaborate scientific theory. In all this there is nothing for praise or admiration. It indicates the presence of moral disease; but fortunately it is functional rather than organic disease. He was right and sound at heart; but he spread his sails too readily to the great winds of popular favour$ and the result was instability to himself$ and often danger of shipwreck to his soul.
Murcia,Murcia $ Spain,-1.1306544,37.9922399,Thus passed the summer and autumn of 1487; precious months$ precious years slipping by$ and the great purpose as yet unfulfilled and seemingly no nearer to fulfilment. It is likely that Columbus kept up his applications to the Court$ and received polite and delaying replies. The next year came$ and the Court migrated from Zaragoza to Murcia$ from Murcia to Valladolid$ from Valladolid to Medina del Campo. Columbus attended it in one or other of these places$ but without result. In August Beatriz gave birth to a son$ who was christened Ferdinand$ and who lived to be a great comfort to his father$ if not to her also. But the miracle of paternity was not now so new and wonderful as it had been; the battle of life$ with its crosses and difficulties$ was thick about him; and perhaps he looked into this new-comers small face with conflicting thoughts$ and memories of the long white beach and the crashing surf at Porto Santo$ and regret for things lostso strangely mingled and inconsistent are the threads of human thought. At last he decided to turn his face elsewhere. In September 1488 he went to Lisbon$ for what purpose it is not certain; possibly in connection with the affairs of his dead wife; and probably also in the expectation of seeing his brother Bartholomew$ to whom we may now turn our attention for a moment.
Brandon,Brandon $ United States,-82.2859247,27.937801,The idea once fixed in his mind that there was land at a not impossible distance to the west$ and perhaps a sea-road to the shores of Asia itself$ the next thing to be done$ was to go and discover it. Rather a formidable task for a man without money$ a foreigner in a strange land$ among people who looked down upon him because of his obscure birth$ and with no equipment except a knowledge of the sea$ a great mastery of the art and craft of seamanship$ a fearless spirit of adventure$ and an inner light! Some one else would have to be convinced before anything could be done; somebody who would provide ships and men and money and provisions. Altogether rather a large order; for it was not an unusual thing in those days for master mariners$ tired of the shore$ to suggest to some grandee or other the desirability of fitting out a ship or two to go in search of the isle of St. Brandon$ or to look up Antilia$ or the island of the Seven Cities. It was very hard to get an audience even for such a reasonable scheme as that; but to suggest taking a flotilla straight out to the west and into the Sea of Darkness$ down that curving hill of the sea which it might be easy enough to slide down$ but up which it was known that no ship could ever climb again$ was a thing that hardly any serious or well-informed person would listen to. A young man from Genoa$ without a knowledge either of the classics or of the Fathers$ and with no other argument except his own fixed belief and some vague talk about bits of wood and shipwrecked mariners$ was not the person to inspire the capitalists of Portugal. Yet the thing had to be done. Obviously it could not be done at Porto Santo$ where there were no ships and no money. Influence must be used; and Columbus knew that his proposals$ if they were to have even a chance of being listened to$ must be presented in some high-flown and elaborate form$ giving reasons and offering inducements and quoting authorities. He would have to get some one to help him in that; he would have to get up some scientific facts; his brother Bartholomew could help him$ and some of those disagreeable relatives-in-law must also be pressed into the service of the Idea. Obviously the first thing was to go back to Lisbon; which accordingly Columbus did$ about the year 1483.

Damascus,Damascus $ Syria,36.2765279,33.5138073,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Cariari,Cariari$ Limón$ Pococí$ Costa Rica,-83.6135572,10.488088,The natives at this anchorage of Cariari were rather suspicious$ but Columbus seized two of them to act as guides in his journey further down the coast. Weighing anchor on October 5th he worked along the Costa Rica shore$ which here turns to the eastward again$ and soon found a tribe of natives who wore large ornaments of gold. They were reluctant to part with the gold$ but as usual pointed down the coast and said that there was much more gold there; they even gave a name to the place where the gold could be foundVeragua; and for once this country was found to have a real existence. The fleet anchored there on October 17th$ being greeted by defiant blasts of conch shells and splashing of water from the indignant natives. Business was done$ however: seventeen gold discs in exchange for three hawks bells.
Mars,Mars$ TX 75778$ USA,-95.7257968,32.3593117,The wind fell lighter and lighter$ and on Friday the little fleet lay becalmed within sight of Ferro. But on Saturday evening north-east airs sprang up again$ and they were able to make nine leagues of westing. On Sunday they had lost sight of land; and at thus finding their ships three lonely specks in the waste of ocean the crew lost heart and began to lament. There was something like a panic$ many of the sailors bursting into tears and imploring Columbus to take them home again. To us it may seem a rather childish exhibition; but it must be remembered that these sailors were unwillingly embarked upon a voyage which they believed would only lead to death and disaster. The bravest of us to-day$ if he found himself press-ganged on board a balloon and embarked upon a journey$ the object of which was to land upon Mars or the moon$ might find it difficult to preserve his composure on losing sight of the earth; and the parallel is not too extreme to indicate the light in which their present enterprise must have appeared to many of the Admirals crew.
New,North Riverside $ United States,-87.8112209,41.847891,All his sins of misgovernment$ then$ may be condoned on the ground that governing is a science$ and that Columbus had never learned it. What we do find$ however$ is that the inner light that had led him across the seas never burned clearly for him again$ and was never his guide in the later part of his life. Its radiance was quenched by the gleam of gold; for there is no doubt that Columbus was a victim of that baleful influence which has caused so much misery in this world. He was greedy of gold for himself undoubtedly; but he was still more greedy of it for Spain. It was his ambition to be the means of filling the coffers of the Spanish Sovereigns and so acquiring immense dignity and glory for himself. He believed that gold was in itself a very precious and estimable thing; he knew that masses and candles could be bought for it$ and very real spiritual privileges; and as he made blunder after blunder$ and saw evil after evil heaping itself on his record in the New World$ he became the more eager and frantic to acquire such a treasure of gold that it would wipe out the other evils of his administration. And once involved in that circle$ there was no help for him.
Fernandina,Fernandina Beach $ United States,-81.46259189999999,30.6696818,The first that I discovered I named San Salvador$ in remembrance of that Almighty Power which had so miraculously bestowed them.

Scotia,Scotia $ United States,-73.9642915,42.8264652,The Egyptians$ the Tartars$ the Canaanites$ the Chinese$ the Arabians$ the Welsh$ and the Scandinavians have all been credited with the colonisation of America; but the only race from the Old World which had almost certainly been there were the Scandinavians. In the year 983 the coast of Greenland was visited by Eric the Red$ the son of a Norwegian noble$ who was banished for the crime of murder. Some fifteen years later Erics son Lief made an expedition with thirty-five men and a ship in the direction of the new land. They came to a coast where there were nothing but ice mountains having the appearance of slate; this country they named Hellulandthat is$ Land of Slate. This country is our Newfoundland. Standing out to sea again$ they reached a level wooded country with white sandy cliffs$ which they called Markland$ or Land of Wood$ which is our Nova Scotia. Next they reached an island east of Markland$ where they passed the winter$ and as one of their number who had wandered some distance inland had found vines and grapes$ Lief named the country Vinland or Vine Land$ which is the country we call New England. The Scandinavians continued to make voyages to the West and South; and finally Thorfinn Karlsefne$ an Icelander$ made a great expedition in the spring of 1007 with ships and material for colonisation. He made much progress to the southwards$ and the Icelandic accounts of the climate and soil and characteristics of the country leave no doubt that Greenland and Nova Scotia were discovered and colonised at this time.
Palms,Las Vegas $ United States,-115.1948136,36.1144832,On Tuesday$ October 30th$ Martin Alonso Pinzon$ whose communications the Admiral was by this time beginning to dread$ came with some exciting news. It seemed that the Indians from San Salvador who were on board the Pinta had told him that beyond the promontory$ named by Columbus the Cape of Palms$ there was a river$ four days journey upon which would bring one to the city of Cuba$ which was very rich and large and abounded with gold; and that the king of that country was at war with a monarch whom they called Cami$ and whom Pinzon identified with the Great Khan. More than this$ these natives assured him that the land they were on at present was the mainland itself$ and that they could not be very far from Cathay. Columbus for once found himself in agreement with Martin Alonso. The well-thumbed copy of Marco Polo was doubtless brought out$ and abundant evidence found in it; and it was decided to despatch a little embassy to this city in order to gain information about its position and wealth. When they continued their course$ however$ and rounded the cape$ no river appeared; they sailed on$ and yet promontory after promontory was opened ahead of them; and as the wind turned against them and the weather was very threatening they decided to turn back and anchor again in the Rio de Mares.
Cuba,Cuba,-77.781167,21.521757,But in the meanwhile the Chapter of the cathedral in San Domingo had made new discoveries and examinations; had found another box of bones$ which bore to them authentic signs that the dust it contained was the Admirals and not his grandsons; and in spite of the Academy of History at Madrid$ it is indeed far from unlikely that the Admirals dust does not lie in Spain or Cuba$ but in San Domingo still. Whole books have been written about these boxes of bones; learned societies have argued about them$ experts have examined the bones and the boxes with microscopes; and meantime the dust of Columbus$ if we take the view that an error was committed in the transference to Cuba$ is not even collected all in one box. A sacrilegious official acquired some of it when the boxes were opened$ and distributed it among various curiosity-hunters$ who have preserved it in caskets of crystal and silver. Thus a bit of him is worn by an American lady in a crystal locket; a pinch of him lies in a glass vial in a New York mansion; other pinches in the Lennox Library$ New York$ in the Vatican$ and in the University of Pavia. In such places$ if the Admiral should fail to appear at the first note of their trumpets$ must the Angels of the Resurrection make search.
Castile,Castile and León$ Spain,-4.397635699999999,41.83568210000001, In the month of May the Admiral was well enough at last to undertake the journey to Segovia. He travelled on a mule$ and was accompanied by his brother Bartholomew and his son Ferdinand. When he reached the Court he found the King civil and outwardly attentive to his recitals$ but apparently content with a show of civility and outward attention. Columbus was becoming really a nuisance; that is the melancholy truth. The King had his own affairs to attend to; he was already meditating a second marriage$ and thinking of the young bride he was to bring home to the vacant place of Isabella; and the very iteration of Columbuss complaints and demands had made them lose all significance for the King. He waved them aside with polite and empty promises$ as people do the demands of importunate children; and finally$ to appease the Admiral and to get rid of the intolerable nuisance of his applications$ he referred the whole question$ first to Archbishop DEA$ and then to the body of councillors which had been appointed to interpret Queen Isabellas will. The whole question at issue was whether or not the original agreement with Columbus$ which had been made before his discoveries$ should be carried out. The King$ who had foolishly subscribed to it simply as a matter of form$ never believing that anything much could come of it$ was determined that it should not be carried out$ as it would give Columbus a wealth and power to which no mere subject of a crown was entitled. The Admiral held fast to his privileges; the only thing that he would consent to submit to arbitration was the question of his revenues; but his titles and territorial authorities he absolutely stuck to. Of course the council did exactly what the King had done. They talked about the thing a great deal$ but they did nothing. Columbus was an invalid and broken man$ who might die any day$ and it was obviously to their interest to gain time by discussion and delaya cruel game for our Christopher$ who knew his days on earth to be numbered$ and who struggled in that web of time in which mortals try to hurry the events of the present and delay the events of the future. Meanwhile Philip of Austria and his wife Juana$ Isabellas daughter$ had arrived from Flanders to assume the crown of Castile$ which Isabella had bequeathed to them. Columbus saw a chance for himself in this coming change$ and he sent Bartholomew as an envoy to greet the new Sovereigns$ and to enlist their services on the Admirals behalf. Bartholomew was very well received$ but he was too late to be of use to the Admiral$ whom he never saw again; and this is our farewell to Bartholomew$ who passes out of our narrative here. He went to Rome after Christophers death on a mission to the Pope concerning some fresh voyages of discovery; and in 1508 he made$ so far as we know$ his one excursion into romance$ when he assisted at the production of an illegitimate little girlhis only descendant. He returned to Espanola under the governorship of his nephew Diego$ and died there in 1514stern$ valiant$ brotherly soul$ whose devotion to Christopher must be for ever remembered and honoured with the name of the Admiral.
Manto,Manta $ Ecuador,-80.7089101,-0.9676533, p127.jpg (55K) The Palos that witnessed the fitting out of the ships of Columbus exists no longer. The soul is gone from it; the trade that in those days made it great and busy has floated away from it into other channels; and it has dwindled and shrunk$ until to-day it consists of nothing but a double street of poor white houses$ such almost as you may see in any sea-coast village in Ireland. The slow salt tides of the Atlantic come flooding in over the Manto bank$ across the bar of Saltes$ and$ dividing at the tongue of land that separates the two rivers$ creep up the mud banks of the Tinto and the Odiel until they lie deep beside the wharves of Huelva and Palos; but although Huelva still has a trade the tides bring nothing to Palos$ and take nothing away with them again. From La Rabida now you can no longer see$ as Columbus saw$ fleets of caravels lying-to and standing off and on outside the bar waiting for the flood tide; only a few poor boats fishing for tunny in the empty sunny waters$ or the smoke of a steamer standing on her course for the Guadalquiver or Cadiz.
Antilia,Mumbai $ India,72.80949629999999,18.9680208,It is another illustration of the way in which discovery and imagination had hitherto gone by steps and not by flights$ that geographical knowledge reached the islands of the Atlantic (none of which were at a very great distance from the coast of Europe or from each other) at a comparatively early date$ and stopped there until in Columbus there was found a man with faith strong enough to make the long flight beyond them to the unknown West. And yet the philosophers$ and later the cartographers$ true to their instinct for this pedestrian kind of imagination$ put mythical lands and islands to the westward of the known islands as though they were really trying to make a way$ to sink stepping stones into the deep sea that would lead their thoughts across the unknown space. In the Catalan map of the world$ which was the standard example of cosmography in the early days of Columbus$ most of these mythical islands are marked. There was the island of Antilia$ which was placed in 25 deg. 35 W.$ and was said to have been discovered by Don Roderick$ the last of the Gothic kings of Spain$ who fled there after his defeat by the Moors. There was the island of the Seven Cities$ which is sometimes identified with this Antilia$ and was the object of a persistent belief or superstition on the part of the inhabitants of the Canary Islands. They saw$ or thought they saw$ about ninety leagues to the westward$ an island with high peaks and deep valleys. The vision was intermittent; it was only seen in very clear weather$ on some of those pure$ serene days of the tropics when in the clear atmosphere distant objects appear to be close at hand. In cloudy$ and often in clear weather also$ it was not to be seen at all; but the inhabitants of the Canaries$ who always saw it in the same place$ were so convinced of its reality that they petitioned the King of Portugal to allow them to go and take possession of it; and several expeditions were in fact despatched$ but none ever came up with that fairy land. It was called the island of the Seven Cities from a legend of seven bishops who had fled from Spain at the time of the Moorish conquest$ and$ landing upon this island$ had founded there seven splendid cities. There was the island of St. Brandan$ called after the Saint who set out from Ireland in the sixth century in search of an island which always receded before his ships; this island was placed several hundred miles to the west of the Canaries on maps and charts through out the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was the island of Brazil$ to the west of Cape St. Vincent; the islands of Royllo$ San Giorgio$ and Isola di Mam; but they were all islands of dreams$ seen by the eyes of many mariners in that imaginative time$ but never trodden by any foot of man. To Columbus$ however$ and the mariners of his day$ they were all real places$ which a man might reach by special good fortune or heroism$ but which$ all things considered$ it was not quite worth the while of any man to attempt to reach. They have all disappeared from our charts$ like the Atlantis of Plato$ that was once charted to the westward of the Straits of Gibraltar$ and of which the Canaries were believed to be the last peaks unsubmerged.
Apennine,Apennine Mountains$ Italy,12.5836413,43.2728024,In the case of Columbus we are spared this dilemma. The past is reticent enough about the man himself; and about his ancestors it is almost silent. We know that he had a father and grandfather$ as all grandsons of Adam have had; but we can be certain of very little more than that. He came of a race of Italian yeomen inhabiting the Apennine valleys; and in the vale of Fontanabuona$ that runs up into the hills behind Genoa$ the two streams of family from which he sprang were united. His father from one hamlet$ his mother from another; the towering hills behind$ the Mediterranean shining in front; love and marriage in the valley; and a little boy to come of it whose doings were to shake the world.
China,China,104.195397,35.86166,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Mares,Boca Raton $ United States,-80.1034956,26.4075857,On Tuesday$ October 30th$ Martin Alonso Pinzon$ whose communications the Admiral was by this time beginning to dread$ came with some exciting news. It seemed that the Indians from San Salvador who were on board the Pinta had told him that beyond the promontory$ named by Columbus the Cape of Palms$ there was a river$ four days journey upon which would bring one to the city of Cuba$ which was very rich and large and abounded with gold; and that the king of that country was at war with a monarch whom they called Cami$ and whom Pinzon identified with the Great Khan. More than this$ these natives assured him that the land they were on at present was the mainland itself$ and that they could not be very far from Cathay. Columbus for once found himself in agreement with Martin Alonso. The well-thumbed copy of Marco Polo was doubtless brought out$ and abundant evidence found in it; and it was decided to despatch a little embassy to this city in order to gain information about its position and wealth. When they continued their course$ however$ and rounded the cape$ no river appeared; they sailed on$ and yet promontory after promontory was opened ahead of them; and as the wind turned against them and the weather was very threatening they decided to turn back and anchor again in the Rio de Mares.
Judea,Tauranga $ New Zealand,176.1344317,-37.696437,I mounted to the top of the ship crying out with a weak voice$ weeping bitterly$ to the commanders of your Majesties army$ and calling again to the four winds to help; but they did not answer me. Tired out$ I fell asleep and sighing I heard a voice very full of pity which spoke these words: O fool! and slow to believe and to serve Him$ thy God and the God of all. What did He more for Moses? and for David His servant? Since thou wast born He had always so great care for thee. When He saw thee in an age with which He was content He made thy name sound marvellously through the world. The Indies$ which are so rich apart of the world$ He has given to thee as thine. Thou hast distributed them wherever it has pleased thee; He gave thee power so to do. Of the bonds of the ocean which were locked with so strong chains He gave thee the keys$ and thou wast obeyed in all the land$ and among the Christians thou hast acquired a good and honourable reputation. What did He more for the people of Israel when He brought them out of Egypt? or yet for David$ whom from being a shepherd He made King of Judea? Turn to Him and recognise thine error$ for His mercy is infinite. Thine old age will be no hindrance to all great things. Many very great inheritances are in His power. Abraham was more than one hundred years old when he begat Isaac and also Sarah was not young. Thou art calling for uncertain aid. Answer me$ who has afflicted thee so much and so many timesGod or the world? The privileges and promises which God makes He never breaks to any one; nor does He say after having received the service that His intention was not so and it is to be understood in another manner: nor imposes martyrdom to give proof of His power. He abides by the letter of His word. All that He promises He abundantly accomplishes. This is His way. I have told thee what the Creator hath done for thee and does for all. Now He shows me the reward and payment of thy suffering and which thou hast passed in the service of others. And thus half dead$ I heard everything; but I could never find an answer to make to words so certain$ and only I wept for my errors. He$ who ever he might be$ finished speaking$ saying: Trust and fear not$ for thy tribulations are written in marble and not without reason.
Ercilla,Ercilla $ Chile,-72.38329999999999,-38.0553156,Columbuss ships were on the point of sailing when word came that the Moors were besieging a Portuguese post on the coast of Morocco$ and$ as civility was now the order of the day between Spain and Portugal$ the Admiral was instructed to call on his way there and afford some relief. This he did$ sailing from Cadiz on the 9th or 10th of May to Ercilla on the Morocco coast$ where he anchored on the 13th. But the Moors had all departed and the siege was over; so Columbus$ having sent Bartholomew and some of his officers ashore on a civil visit$ which was duly returned$ set out the same day on his last voyage.
Town,Memphis $ United States,-90.0489801,35.1495343,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Palos,Palos Township$ IL$ USA,-87.8353278,41.6805878,Yet another of our old friends profited by the Admirals discovery. What Vincenti Yafiez Pinzon has been doing all these years we have no record; living at Palos$ perhaps$ doing a little of his ordinary coasting business$ administering the estates of his brother Martin Alonso$ and$ almost for a certainty$ talking pretty big about who it was that really did all the work in the discovery of the New World. Out of the obscurity of conjecture he emerges into fact in December 1499$ when he is found at Palos fitting out four caravels for the purpose of exploring farther along the coast of the southern mainland. That he also was after pearls is pretty certain; but on the other hand he was more of a sailor than an adventurer$ was a discoverer at heart$ and had no small share of the family taste for sea travel. He took a more southerly course than any of the others and struck the coast of America south of the equator on January 20$ 1500. He sailed north past the mouths of the Amazon and Orinoco through the Gulf of Paria$ and reached Espanola in June 1500. He only paused there to take in provisions$ and sailed to the west in search of further discoveries; but he lost two of his caravels in a gale and had to put back to Espanola.
Moguer,Moguer $ Spain,-6.8369079,37.27464,A great quantity of birds that began to fly about the ship made him think that they were near land$ but they turned out to be the harbingers of a storm. On Tuesday$ February 12th$ the sea and wind began to rise$ and it continued to blow harder throughout that night and the next day. The wind being aft he went under bare poles most of the night$ and when day came hoisted a little sail; but the sea was terrible$ and if he had not been so sure of the staunch little Nina he would have felt himself in danger of being lost. The next day the sea$ instead of going down$ increased in roughness; there was a heavy cross sea which kept breaking right over the ship$ and it became necessary to make a little sail in order to run before the wind$ and to prevent the vessel falling back into the trough of the seas. All through Thursday he ran thus under the half hoisted staysail$ and he could see the Pinta running also before the wind$ although since she presented more surface$ and was able to carry a little more sail than the Nina$ she was soon lost to sight. The Admiral showed lights through the night$ and this time there was no lack of response from Martin Alonso; and for some part of that dark and stormy night these two humanly freighted scraps of wood and cordage staggered through the gale showing lights to each other; until at last the light from the Pinta disappeared. When morning came she was no longer to be seen; and the wind and the sea had if anything increased. The Nina was now in the greatest danger. Any one wave of the heavy cross sea$ if it had broken fairly across her$ would have sunk her; and she went swinging and staggering down into the great valleys and up into the hills$ the steersmans heart in his mouth$ and the whole crew in an extremity of fear. Columbus$ who generally relied upon his seamanship$ here invoked external aid$ and began to offer bargains to the Almighty. He ordered that lots should be cast$ and that he upon whom the lot fell should make a vow to go on pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Guadaloupe carrying a white candle of five pounds weight. Same dried peas were brought$ one for every member of the crew$ and on one of them a cross was marked with a knife; the peas were well shaken and were put into a cap. The first to draw was the Admiral; he drew the marked pea$ and he made the vow. Lots were again drawn$ this time for a greater pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Loretto in Ancona; and the lot fell on a seaman named Pedro de Villa$the expenses of whose pilgrimage Columbus promised to pay. Again lots were drawn for a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Clara of Moguer$ the pilgrim to watch and pray for one night there; and again the lot fell on Columbus. In addition to these$ every one$ since they took themselves for lost$ made some special and private vow or bargain with God; and finally they all made a vow together that at the first land they reached they would go in procession in their shirts to pray at an altar of Our Lady.
Pinos,Wichita $ United States,-97.3551624,37.6837535,After the shattering experience of the storm$ Columbus$ although he did not return to San Domingo$ remained for some time on the coast of Espanola repairing his ships and resting his exhausted crews. There were threatenings of another storm which delayed them still further$ and it was not until the middle of July that the Admiral was able to depart on the real purpose of his voyage. His object was to strike the mainland far to the westward of the Gulf of Paria$ and so by following it back eastward to find the passage which he believed to exist. But the winds and currents were very baffling; he was four days out of sight of land after touching at an island north of Jamaica; and finally$ in some bewilderment$ he altered his course more and more northerly until he found his whereabouts by coming in sight of the archipelago off the south-western end of Cuba which he had called the Gardens. From here he took a departure south-west$ and on the 30th of July came in sight of a small island off the northern coast of Honduras which he called Isla de Pinos$ and from which he could see the hills of the mainland. At this island he found a canoe of immense size with a sort of house or caboose built amidships$ in which was established a cacique with his family and dependents; and the people in the canoe showed signs of more advanced civilisation than any seen by Columbus before in these waters. They wore clothing$ they had copper hatchets$ and bells$ and palm-wood swords in the edges of which were set sharp blades of flint. They had a fermented liquor$ a kind of maize beer which looked like English ale; they had some kind of money or medium of exchange also$ and they told the Admiral that there was land to the west where all these things existed and many more. It is strange and almost inexplicable that he did not follow this trail to the westward; if he had done so he would have discovered Mexico. But one thing at a time always occupied him to the exclusion of everything else; his thoughts were now turned to the eastward$ where he supposed the Straits were; and the significance of this canoe full of natives was lost upon him.
Eden,Eden$ 8$ LA 71371$ USA,-92.2151346,31.6540615,The anxiety of Columbus to communicate the names of things before he had made sure of their substance received another rude chastisement in the events that followed the receipt in Spain of his letter announcing the discovery of the Garden of Eden and the land of pearls. People in Spain were not greatly interested in his theories of the terrestrial Paradise; but more than one adventurer pricked up his ears at the name of pearls$ and among the first was our old friend Alonso de Ojeda$ who had returned some time before from Espanola and was living in Spain. His position as a member of Columbuss force on the second voyage and the distinction he had gained there gave him special opportunities of access to the letters and papers sent home by Columbus; and he found no difficulty in getting Fonseca to show him the maps and charts of the coast of Paria sent back by the Admiral$ the veritable pearls which had been gathered$ and the enthusiastic descriptions of the wealth of this new coast. Knowing something of Espanola$ and of the Admiral also$ and reading in the despatches of the turbulent condition of the colony$ he had a shrewd idea that Columbuss hands would be kept pretty full in Espanola itself$ and that he would have no opportunity for some time to make any more voyages of discovery. He therefore represented to Fonseca what a pity it would be if all this revenue should remain untapped just because one man had not time to attend to it$ and he proposed that he should take out an expedition at his own cost and share the profits with the Crown.
Riviera,Riviera $ United States,-97.8148885,27.2986493,Here$ then$ between the narrow little house by the Gate and the clamour and business of the sea-front$ our Christophers feet carried him daily during some part of his childish life. What else he did$ what he thought and felt$ what little reflections he had$ are but matters of conjecture. Genoa will tell you nothing more. You may walk over the very spot where he was born; you may unconsciously tread in the track of his vanished feet; you may wander about the wharves of the city$ and see the ships loading and unloadingdifferent ships$ but still trafficking in commodities not greatly different from those of his day; you may climb the heights behind Genoa$ and look out upon the great curving Gulf from Porto Fino to where the Cape of the western Riviera dips into the sea; you may walk along the coast to Savona$ where Domenico had one of his many habitations$ where he kept the tavern$ and whither Christophers young feet must also have walked; and you may come back and search again in the harbour$ from the old Mole and the Bank of St. George to where the port and quays stretch away to the medley of sailing-ships and steamers; but you will not find any sign or trace of Christopher. No echo of the little voice that shrilled in the narrow street sounds in the Vico Dritto; the houses stand gaunt and straight$ with a brilliant strip of blue sky between their roofs and the cool street beneath; but they give you nothing of what you seek. If you see a little figure running towards you in a blue smock$ the head fair-haired$ the face blue-eyed and a little freckled with the strong sunshine$ it is not a real figure; it is a child of your dreams and a ghost of the past. You may chase him while he runs about the wharves and stumbles over the ropes$ but you will never catch him. He runs before you$ zigzagging over the cobbles$ up the sunny street$ into the narrow house; out again$ running now towards the Duomo$ hiding in the porch of San Stefano$ where the weavers held their meetings; back again along the wharves; surely he is hiding behind that mooring-post! But you look$ and he is not therenothing but the old harbour dust that the wind stirs into a little eddy while you look. For he belongs not to you or me$ this child; he is not yet enslaved to the great purpose$ not yet caught up into the machinery of life. His eye has not yet caught the fire of the sun setting on a western sea; he is still free and happy$ and belongs only to those who love him. Father and mother$ brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo$ sister Biancinetta$ aunts$ uncles$ and cousins possibly$ and possibly for a little while an old grandmother at Quintothese were the people to whom that child belonged. The little life of his first decade$ unviolated by documents or history$ lives happily in our dreams$ as blank as sunshine.
Tortuga,Fort Lauderdale $ United States,-80.1066025,26.1086986,The local chief came on a visit of state to the ship; and the Admiral paid him due honour$ telling him that he came as an envoy from the greatest sovereigns in the world. But this charming king$ or cacique as they called him$ would not believe this; he thought that Columbus was$ for reasons of modesty$ speaking less than the trutha new charge to bring against our Christopher! He believed that the Spaniards came from heaven$ and that the realms of the sovereigns of Castile were in the heavens and not in this world. He took some refreshment$ as his councillors did also$ little dreaming$ poor wretches$ what in after years was to come to them through all this palavering and exchanging of presents. The immediate result of the interview$ however$ was to make intercourse with the natives much freer and pleasanter even than it had been before; and some of the sailors went fishing with the natives. It was then that they were shown some cane arrows with hardened points$ which the natives said belonged to the people of Caniba$ who$ they alleged$ came to the island to capture and eat the natives. The Admiral did not believe it; his sublime habit of rejecting everything that did not fit in with his theory of the moment$ and accepting everything that did$ made him shake his head when this piece of news was brought to him. He could not get the Great Khan out of his head$ and his present theory was that this island$ being close to the mainland of Cathay$ was visited by the armies of the Great Khan$ and that it was his men who had used the arrows and made war upon the natives. It was no good for the natives to show him some of their mutilated bodies$ and to tell him that the cannibals ate them piecemeal; he had no use for such information. His mind was like a sieve of which the size of the meshes could be adjusted at will; everything that was not germane to the idea of the moment fell through it$ and only confirmative evidence remained; and at the moment he was not believing any stories which did not prove that the Great Khan was$ so to speak$ just round the corner. If they talked about gold he would listen to them; and so the cacique brought him a piece of gold the size of his hand and$ breaking it into pieces$ gave it to him a bit at a time. This the Admiral took to be sign of great intelligence. They told him there was gold at Tortuga$ but he preferred to believe that it came from Babeque$ which may have been Jamaica and may have been nothing at all.
Nina,Neenah $ United States,-88.462609,44.1858193,Columbus did not stand out to sea on his homeward course immediately$ but still coasted along the shores of the island as though he were loth to leave it$ and as though he might still at some bend of a bay or beyond some verdant headland come upon the mines and jewels that he longed for. The mountain that he passed soon after starting he called Monte Christi$ which name it bears to this day; and he saw many other mountains and capes and bays$ to all of which he gave names. And it was a fortunate chance which led him thus to stand along the coast of the island; for on January 6th the sailor who was at the masthead$ looking into the clear water for shoals and rocks$ reported that he saw the caravel Pinta right ahead. When she came up with him$ as they were in very shallow water not suitable for anchorage$ Columbus returned to the bay of Monte Christi to anchor there. Presently Martin Alonso Pinzon came on board to report himselfa somewhat crestfallen Martin$ we may be sure$ for he had failed to find the gold the hope of which had led him to break his honour as a seaman. But the Martin Alonsos of this world$ however sorry their position may be$ will always find some kind of justification for it. It must have been a trying moment for Martin Alonso as his boat from the Pinta drew near the Nina$ and he saw the stalwart commanding figure of the white-haired Admiral walking the poop. He knew very well that according to the law and custom of the sea Columbus would have been well within his right in shooting him or hanging him on the spot; but Martin puts on a bold face as$ with a cold dread at his heart and (as likely as not) an ingratiating smile upon his face he comes up over the side. Perhaps$ being in some ways a cleverer man than Christopher$ he knew the Admirals weak points; knew that he was kind-hearted$ and would remember those days of preparation at Palos when Martin Alonso had been his principal stay and help. Martins story was that he had been separated from the Admiral against his will; that the crew insisted upon it$ and that in any case they had only meant to go and find some gold and bring it back to the Admiral. Columbus did not believe him for a moment$ but either his wisdom or his weakness prevented him from saying so. He reproached Martin Alonso for acting with pride and covetousness that night when he went away and left him; and Columbus could not think from whence had come the haughty actions and dishonesty Martin had shown towards him on that voyage. Martin had done a good trade and had got a certain amount of gold; and no doubt he knew well in what direction to turn the conversation when it was becoming unpleasant to himself. He told Columbus of an island to the south of Juana[Cuba]called Yamaye$[Jamaica]where pieces of gold were taken from the mines as large as kernels of wheat$ and of another island towards the east which was inhabited only by women.
Ceuta,Ceuta $ Spain,-5.3213455,35.8893874,Before these three learned men must Columbus now appear$ a little less happy in his mind$ and wishing that he knew more Latin. Master Rodrigo$ Master Joseph the Jew$ the Right Reverend Cazadilla: three pairs of cold eyes turned rather haughtily on the Genoese adventurer; three brains much steeped in learning$ directed in judgment on the Idea of a man with no learning at all. The Right Reverend Cazadilla$ being the Kings confessor$ and a bishop into the bargain$ could speak on that matter of converting the heathen; and he was of opinion that it could not be done. Joseph the Jew$ having made voyages$ and worked with Behaim at the astrolabe$ was surely an authority on navigation; and he was of opinion that it could not be done. Rodrigo$ being also a very learned man$ had read many books which Columbus had not read; and he was of opinion that it could not be done. Three learned opinions against one Idea; the Idea is bound to go. They would no doubt question Columbus on the scientific aspect of the matter$ and would soon discover his grievous lack of academic knowledge. They would quote fluently passages from writers that he had not heard of; if he had not heard of them$ they seemed to imply$ no wonder he made such foolish proposals. Poor Columbus stands there puzzled$ dissatisfied$ tongue-tied. He cannot answer these wiseacres in their own learned lingo; what they say$ or what they quote$ may be true or it may not; but it has nothing to do with his Idea. If he opens his mouth to justify himself$ they refute him with arguments that he does not understand; there is a wall between them. More than a wall; there is a world between them! It is his credo against their ignoro; it is$ his expecto against their non video. Yet in his credo there lies a power of which they do not dream; and it rings out in a trumpet note across the centuries$ saluting the life force that opposes its irresistible I will to the feeble Thou canst not of the worldly-wise. Thus$ in about the year 1483$ did three learned men sit in judgment upon our ignorant Christopher. Three learned men: Doctors Rodrigo$ Joseph the Jew$ and the Right Reverend Cazadilla$ Bishop of Ceuta; three risen$ stuffed to the eyes and ears with learning; stuffed so full indeed that eyes and ears are closed with it. And three men$ it would appear$ wholly destitute of mother-wit.
Hispaniola,Hispaniola,-71.5723953,19.0018663,And now$ just at the moment when he needs it most$ comes an incident that$ to a man of his religious and superstitious habit$ seems like the pointing finger of Providence. The story of the shipwrecked pilot has been discredited by nearly all the modern biographers of Columbus$ chiefly because it does not fit in with their theory of his scientific studies and the alleged bearing of these on his great discovery; but it is given by Las Casas$ who says that it was commonly believed by Columbuss entourage at Hispaniola. Moreover$ amid all the tangles of theory and argument in which the achievement of Columbus has been involved$ this original story of shipwrecked mariners stands out with a strength and simplicity that cannot be entirely disregarded by the historian who permits himself some light of imagination by which to work. It is more true to life and to nature that Columbus should have received his last impulse$ the little push that was to set his accumulated energy and determination in motion$ from a thing of pure chance$ than that he should have built his achievement up in a logical superstructure resting on a basis of profound and elaborate theory.
Miguel,San Diego $ United States,-117.1610838,32.715738,It was on the 20th of August that Columbus$ having the day before seen the last of the dim blue hills of Jamaica$ sighted again the long peninsula of Hayti$ called by him Cape San Miguel$ but known to us as Cape Tiburon; although it was not until he was hailed by a cacique who called out to him Almirante$ Almirante$ that the seaworn mariners realised with joy that the island must be Espanola. But they were a long way from Isabella yet. They sailed along the south coast$ meeting contrary winds$ and at one point landing nine men who were to cross the island$ and try to reach Isabella by land. Week followed week$ and they made very poor progress. In the beginning of September they were caught in a severe tempest$ which separated the ships for a time$ and held the Admiral weather-bound for eight days. There was an eclipse of the moon during this period$ and he took advantage of it to make an observation for longitude$ by which he found himself to be 5 hrs. 23 min.$ or 80 deg. 40$ west of Cadiz. In this observation there is an error of eighteen degrees$ the true longitude of the island of Saona$ where the observation was taken$ being 62 deg. 20 west of Cadiz; and the error is accounted for partly by the inaccuracy of the tables of Regiomontanus and partly by the crudity and inexactness of the Admirals methods. On the 24th of September they at last reached the easternmost point of Espanola$ named by Columbus San Rafael. They stood to the east a little longer$ and discovered the little island of Mona$ which lies between Espanola and Puerto Rico; and from thence shaped their course west-by-north for Isabella. And no sooner had the course been set for home than the Admiral suddenly and completely collapsed; was carried unconscious to his cabin; and lay there in such extremity that his companions gave him up for lost.

Rota,Rota $ Spain,-6.3601441,36.6236874,His first care was to take little Diego to the town of Huelva$ where there lived a sister of Philippas who had married a Spaniard named Muliartes. This done$ he was able to devote himself solely to the furtherance of his Idea. For this purpose he went to Seville$ where he attached himself for a little while to a group of his countrymen who were settled there$ among them Antonio and Alessandro Geraldini$ and made such momentary living as was possible to him by his old trade. But the Idea would not sleep. He talked of nothing else; and as men do who talk of an idea that possesses them wholly$ and springs from the inner light of faith$ he interested and impressed many of his hearers. Some of them suggested one thing$ some another; but every one was agreed that it would be a good thing if he could enlist the services of the great Count (afterwards Duke) of Medini Celi$ who had a palace at Rota$ near Cadiz.
Ocean,Ocean County$ NJ$ USA,-74.3118212,39.9652553,This conception of the world excluded the Pacific Ocean and the continent of North and South America$ and made it reasonable to suppose that any one who sailed westward long enough from Spain would ultimately reach Cathay and the Indies. Behaims globe$ which was completed in the year 1492$ represented the farthest point that geographical knowledge had reached previous to the discoveries of Columbus$ and on it is shown the island of Cipango or Japan.
Aragon,Aragon$ Spain,-0.9056623,41.5976275,This Pope$ who was a native of Aragon and had been a subject of Ferdinand$ was a stolid$ perverse$ and stubborn being; so much is advertised in his low forehead$ impudent prominent nose$ thick sensual lips$ and stout bull neck. This Pope considers the matter; considers$ by such lights as he has$ to whom he shall entrust the souls of these new heathen; considers which country$ Spain or Portugal$ is most likely to hold and use the same for the increase of the Christian faith in general$ the furtherance of the Holy Catholic Church in special$ and the aggrandisement of Popes in particular; and shrewdly decides that the country in which the. Inquisition can flourish is the country to whom the heathen souls should be entrusted. He therefore issues a Bull$ dated May 3$ 1493$ granting to the Spanish the possession of all lands$ not occupied by Christian powers$ that lie west of a meridian drawn one hundred leagues to the westward of the Azores$ and to the Portuguese possession of all similar lands lying to the eastward of that line. He sleeps upon this Bull$ and has inspiration; and on the morrow$ May 4th$ issues another Bull$ drawing a line from the arctic to the antarctic pole$ and granting to Spain all heathen inheritance to the westward of the same. The Pope$ having signed this Bull$ considers it further-assisted$ no doubt$ by the Portuguese Ambassador at the Vatican$ to whom it has been shown; realises that in the wording of the Bull an injustice has been done to Portugal$ since Spain is allowed to fix very much at her own convenience the point at which the line drawn from pole to pole shall cut the equator; and also because$ although Spain is given all the lands in existence within her territory$ Portugal is only given the lands which she may actually have occupied. Even the legal mind of the Pope$ although much drowsed and blunted by brutish excesses$ discerns faultiness in this document; and consequently on the same day issues a third Bull$ in which the injustice to Portugal is redressed. Nothing so easy$ thinks the Pope$ as to issue Bulls; if you make a mistake in one Bull$ issue another; and$ having issued three Bulls in twenty-four hours$ he desists for the present$ having divided the earthly globe.
Newfoundland,Newfoundland and Labrador$ Canada,-57.6604364,53.1355091,The reasons for doubting that this voyage took place are due simply to Columbuss habit of being untruthful in regard to his own past doings$ and his propensity for drawing the long bow; and the reason that has been accepted by most of his biographers who have denied the truth of this statement is that$ in the year 1492$ when Columbus was addressing the King and Queen of Spain on his qualifications as a navigator$ and when he wished to set forth his experience in a formidable light$ he said nothing about this voyage$ but merely described his explorations as having extended from Guinea on the south to England on the north. A shrewd estimate of Columbuss character makes it indeed seem incredible that$ if he had really been in Iceland$ he should not have mentioned the fact on this occasion; and yet there is just one reason$ also quite characteristic of Columbus$ that would account for the suppression. It is just possible that when he was at Thule$ by which he meant Iceland$ he may have heard of the explorations in the direction of Greenland and Newfoundland; and that$ although by other navigators these lands were regarded as a part of the continent of Europe$ he may have had some glimmerings of an idea that they were part of land and islands in the West; and he was much too jealous of his own reputation as the great and only originator of the project for voyaging to the West$ to give away any hints that he was not the only person to whom such ideas had occurred. There is deception and untruth somewhere; and one must make ones choice between regarding the story in the first place as a lie$ or accepting it as truth$ and putting down Columbuss silence about it on a later occasion to a rare instinct of judicious suppression. There are other facts in his life$ to which$ we shall come later$ that are in accordance with this theory. There is no doubt$ moreover$ that Columbus had a very great experience of the sea$ and was one of the greatest practical seamen$ if not the greatest$ that has ever lived; and it would be foolish to deny$ except for the greatest reasons$ that he made a voyage to the far North$ which was neither unusual at the time nor a very great achievement for a seaman of his experience.
Seneca,Seneca $ United States,-82.9532036,34.6856555,Christopher was fourteen years old when he first went to sea. That is his own statement$ and it is one of the few of his autobiographical utterances that we need not doubt. From it$ and from a knowledge of certain other dates$ we are able to construct some vague picture of his doings before he left Italy and settled in Portugal. Already in his young heart he was feeling the influence that was to direct and shape his destiny; already$ towards his home in Genoa$ long ripples from the commotion of maritime adventure in the West were beginning to spread. At the age of ten he was apprenticed to his father$ who undertook$ according to the indentures$ to provide him with board and lodging$ a blue gabardine and a pair of good shoes$ and various other matters in return for his service. But there is no reason to suppose that he ever occupied himself very much with wool-weaving. He had a vocation quite other than that$ and if he ever did make any cloth there must have been some strange thoughts and imaginings woven into it$ as he plied the shuttle. Most of his biographers$ relying upon a doubtful statement in the life of him written by his son Ferdinand$ would have us send him at the age of twelve to the distant University of Pavia$ there$ poor mite$ to sit at the feet of learned professors studying Latin$ mathematics$ and cosmography; but fortunately it is not necessary to believe so improbable a statement. What is much more likely about his educationfor education he had$ although not of the superior kind with which he has been creditedis that in the blank$ sunny time of his childhood he was sent to one of the excellent schools established by the weavers in their own quarter$ and that there or afterwards he came under some influence$ both religious and learned$ which stamped him the practical visionary that he remained throughout his life. Thereafter$ between his sea voyagings and expeditions about the Mediterranean coasts$ he no doubt acquired knowledge in the only really practical way that it can be acquired; that is to say$ he received it as and when he needed it. What we know is that he had in later life some knowledge of the works of Aristotle$ Julius Caesar$ Seneca$ Pliny$ and Ptolemy; of Ahmet-Ben-Kothair the Arabic astronomer$ Rochid the Arabian$ and the Rabbi Samuel the Jew; of Isadore the Spaniard$ and Bede and Scotus the Britons; of Strabo the German$ Gerson the Frenchman$ and Nicolaus de Lira the Italian. These names cover a wide range$ but they do not imply university education. Some of them merely suggest acquaintance with the Imago Mundi; others imply that selective faculty$ the power of choosing what can help a mans purpose and of rejecting what is useless to it$ that is one of the marks of genius$ and an outward sign of the inner light.
Teneriffe,Teneriffe $ Australia,153.048609,-27.4563879,Columbus left Pinzon on the Grand Canary with orders to try to obtain a caravel there$ while he sailed on to Gomera$ which he reached on Sunday night$ with a similar purpose. As he was unsuccessful he sent a message by a boat that was going back to tell Pinzon to beach the Pinta and repair her rudder; and having spent more days in fruitless search for a vessel$ he started back to join Pinzon on August 23rd. During the night he passed the Peak of Teneriffe$ which was then in eruption. The repairs to the Pinta$ doubtless in no way expedited by Messrs. Rascon and Quintera$ took longer than had been expected; it was found necessary to make an entirely new rudder for her; and advantage was taken of the delay to make some alterations in the rig of the Nina$ which was changed from a latine rig to a square rig$ so that she might be better able to keep up with the others. September had come before these two jobs were completed; and on the 2nd of September the three ships sailed for Gomera$ the most westerly of the islands$ where they anchored in the north-east bay. The Admiral was in a great hurry to get away from the islands and from the track of merchant ships$ for he had none too much confidence in the integrity of his crews$ which were already murmuring and finding every mishap a warning sign from God. He therefore only stayed long enough at Gomera to take in wood and water and provisions$ and set sail from that island on the 6th of September.
Guerra,San Antonio de Guerra $ Dominican Republic,-69.70123219999999,18.5576845,They did a little quiet discovery$ principally in the domain of human nature$ caroused with the friendly natives$ but attended to business all the time; with the result that in the following April they were back in Spain with a treasure of pearls out of which$ after Nifio had been made independent for life and Guerra$ Christoval$ and the rest of them had their shares$ there remained a handsome sum for the Crown. An extremely practical$ businesslike voyage this; full of lessons for our poor Christopher$ could he but have known and learned them.
of,Tulsa $ United States,-95.946,36.1519879,But he was not back in Espanola yet$ and his means for getting there were crumbling away beneath his feet. One of the three remaining caravels was entirely riddled by seaworms and had to be abandoned at the harbour called Puerto Bello; and the company was crowded on to two ships. The men now became more than ever discontented at the easterly course$ and on May 1st$ when he had come as far east as the Gulf of Darien$ Columbus felt obliged to bear away to the north$ although as it turned out he had not nearly made enough easting. He stood on this course$ for nine days$ the west-going current setting him down all the time; and the first land that he made$ on May 10th$ was the group of islands off the western end of Cuba which he had called the Queens Gardens.
Malmsey,Malmsey House$ Vauxhall St$ Lambeth$ London SE11 5LT$ UK,-0.1164294,51.4882019,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Adelantado,Adelantado $ Spain,-16.4007558,28.4895789,I have already said that I wrote to him and to the friars$ and immediately set out$ as I told him$ almost alone$ because all the people were with the Adelantado$ and likewise in order to prevent suspicion on his part. When he heard this$ he seized Don Diego and sent him on board a caravel loaded with irons$ and did the same to me upon my arrival$ and afterwards to the Adelantado when he came; nor did I speak to him any more$ nor to this day has he allowed any one to speak to me; and I take my oath that I cannot understand why I am made a prisoner.
Austria,Austria,14.550072,47.516231, In the month of May the Admiral was well enough at last to undertake the journey to Segovia. He travelled on a mule$ and was accompanied by his brother Bartholomew and his son Ferdinand. When he reached the Court he found the King civil and outwardly attentive to his recitals$ but apparently content with a show of civility and outward attention. Columbus was becoming really a nuisance; that is the melancholy truth. The King had his own affairs to attend to; he was already meditating a second marriage$ and thinking of the young bride he was to bring home to the vacant place of Isabella; and the very iteration of Columbuss complaints and demands had made them lose all significance for the King. He waved them aside with polite and empty promises$ as people do the demands of importunate children; and finally$ to appease the Admiral and to get rid of the intolerable nuisance of his applications$ he referred the whole question$ first to Archbishop DEA$ and then to the body of councillors which had been appointed to interpret Queen Isabellas will. The whole question at issue was whether or not the original agreement with Columbus$ which had been made before his discoveries$ should be carried out. The King$ who had foolishly subscribed to it simply as a matter of form$ never believing that anything much could come of it$ was determined that it should not be carried out$ as it would give Columbus a wealth and power to which no mere subject of a crown was entitled. The Admiral held fast to his privileges; the only thing that he would consent to submit to arbitration was the question of his revenues; but his titles and territorial authorities he absolutely stuck to. Of course the council did exactly what the King had done. They talked about the thing a great deal$ but they did nothing. Columbus was an invalid and broken man$ who might die any day$ and it was obviously to their interest to gain time by discussion and delaya cruel game for our Christopher$ who knew his days on earth to be numbered$ and who struggled in that web of time in which mortals try to hurry the events of the present and delay the events of the future. Meanwhile Philip of Austria and his wife Juana$ Isabellas daughter$ had arrived from Flanders to assume the crown of Castile$ which Isabella had bequeathed to them. Columbus saw a chance for himself in this coming change$ and he sent Bartholomew as an envoy to greet the new Sovereigns$ and to enlist their services on the Admirals behalf. Bartholomew was very well received$ but he was too late to be of use to the Admiral$ whom he never saw again; and this is our farewell to Bartholomew$ who passes out of our narrative here. He went to Rome after Christophers death on a mission to the Pope concerning some fresh voyages of discovery; and in 1508 he made$ so far as we know$ his one excursion into romance$ when he assisted at the production of an illegitimate little girlhis only descendant. He returned to Espanola under the governorship of his nephew Diego$ and died there in 1514stern$ valiant$ brotherly soul$ whose devotion to Christopher must be for ever remembered and honoured with the name of the Admiral.
Japan,Japan,138.252924,36.204824,This conception of the world excluded the Pacific Ocean and the continent of North and South America$ and made it reasonable to suppose that any one who sailed westward long enough from Spain would ultimately reach Cathay and the Indies.

Brazil,Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,The coast of the mainland had thus been explored from the Bay of Honduras to Brazil$ and Columbus was obliged to admit that there was no strait. Having satisfied himself of that he decided to turn back to Veragua$ where he had seen the natives smelting gold$ in order to make some arrangement for establishing a colony there. The wind$ however$ which had headed him almost all the way on his easterly voyage$ headed him again now and began to blow steadily from the west. He started on his return journey on the 5th of December$ and immediately fell into almost worse troubles than he had been in before. The wood of the ships had been bored through and through by seaworms$ so that they leaked very badly; the crews were sick$ provisions were spoilt$ biscuits rotten. Young Ferdinand Columbus$ if he did not actually make notes of this voyage at the time$ preserved a very lively recollection of it$ and it is to his Historie$ which in its earlier passages is of doubtful authenticity$ that we owe some of the most human touches of description relating to this voyage. Any passage in his work relating to food or animals at this time has the true ring of boyish interest and observation$ and is in sharp contrast to the second-hand and artificial tone of the earlier chapters of his book. About the incident of the howling monkey$ which the Admirals Irish hound would not face$ Ferdinand remarks that it frighted a good dog that we had$ but frighted one of our wild boars a great deal more; and as to the condition of the biscuits when they turned westward again$ he says that they were so full of weevils that$ as God shall help me$ I saw many that stayed till night to eat their sop for fear of seeing them.
Island,Iceland,-19.020835,64.963051,But life$ even to the discoverer of a New World$ does not consist of wandering in the groves$ and listening to the singing birds$ and smelling the flowers$ and remembering the May nights of Andalusia. There was gold to be found and the mainland of Cathay to be discovered$ and a letter$ written by the sovereigns at his earnest request$ to be delivered to the Great Khan. The natives had told him of an island called Samoete to the southward$ which was said to contain a quantity of gold. He sailed thither on the 19th$ and called it Isabella; its modern name is Crooked Island. He anchored here and found it to be but another step in the ascending scale of his delight; it was greener and more beautiful than any of the islands he had yet seen. He spent some time looking for the gold$ but could not find any; although he heard of the island of Cuba$ which he took to be the veritable Cipango. He weighed anchor on October 24th and sailed south-west$ encountering some bad weather on the way; but on Sunday the 28th he came up with the north coast of Cuba and entered the mouth of a river which is the modern Nuevitas. To the island of Cuba he gave the name of Juana in honour of the young prince to whom his son Diego had been appointed a page.
Carthage,Carthage$ Tunisia,10.3217245,36.8529199,This stream of life has grown in force and volume with the passage of ages. It has always set from shore to sea in countless currents of adventure and speculation; but it has set most strongly from East to West. On its broad bosom the seeds of life and knowledge have been carried throughout the world. It brought the people of Tyre and Carthage to the coasts and oceans of distant worlds; it carried the English from Jutland across cold and stormy waters to the islands of their conquest; it carried the Romans across half the world; it bore the civilisation of the far East to new life and virgin western soils; it carried the new West to the old East$ and is in our day bringing back again the new East to the old West. Religions$ arts$ tradings$ philosophies$ vices and laws have been borne$ a strange flotsam$ upon its unchanging flood. It has had its springs and neaps$ its trembling high-water marks$ its hour of affluence$ when the world has been flooded with golden humanity; its ebb and effluence also$ when it has seemed to shrink and desert the kingdoms set upon its shores. The fifteenth century in Western Europe found it at a pause in its movements: it had brought the trade and the learning of the East to the verge of the Old World$ filling the harbours of the Mediterranean with ships and the monasteries of Italy and Spain with wisdom; and in the subsequent and punctual decadence that followed this flood$ there gathered in the returning tide a greater energy and volume which was to carry the Old World bodily across the ocean. And yet$ for all their wisdom and power$ the Spanish and Portuguese were still in the attitude of our primitive man$ standing on the sea-shore and looking out in wonder across the sea.
Juan,Austin $ United States,-97.71906580000001,30.25535369999999,Having thus set things going in the interior$ and once more restored Isabella to something like order$ he decided to take three ships and attempt to discover the coast of Cathay. The old Nina$ the San Juan$ and the Cordera$ three small caravels$ were provisioned for six months and manned by a company of fifty-two men. Francisco Nino went once more with the Admiral as pilot$ and the faithful Juan de la Cosa was taken to draw charts; one of the monks also$ to act as chaplain. The Admiral had a steward$ a secretary$ ten seamen and six boys to complete the company on the Nina. The San Juan was commanded by Alonso Perez Roldan and the Cordera by Christoval Nino. Diego was again left in command of the colony$ with four counsellors$ Friar Buil$ Fernandez Coronel$ Alonso Sanchez Carvajal$ and Juan de Luxan$ to assist his authority.
Tobago,Tobago$ Trinidad and Tobago,-60.69889089999999,11.2336911,On August 11th Columbus turned east again after having given up the attempt to find a passage to the north round Paria. There were practical considerations that brought him to this action. As the water was growing shoaler and shoaler he had sent a caravel of light draft some way further to the westward$ and she reported that there lay ahead of her a great inner bay or gulf consisting of almost entirely fresh water. Provisions$ moreover$ were running short$ and were$ as usual$ turning bad; the Admirals health made vigorous action of any kind impossible for him; he was anxious about the condition of Espanolaanxious also$ as we have seen$ to send this great news home; and he therefore turned back and decided to risk the passage of the Dragons Mouth. He anchored in the neighbouring harbour until the wind was in the right quarter$ and with some trepidation put his ships into the boiling tideway. When they were in the middle of the passage the wind fell to a dead calm$ and the ships$ with their sails hanging loose$ were borne on the dizzy surface of eddies$ overfalls$ and whirls of the tide. Fortunately there was deep water in the passage$ and the strength of the current carried them safely through. Once outside they bore away to the northward$ sighting the islands of Tobago and Grenada and$ turning westward again$ came to the islands of Cubagua and Margarita$ where three pounds of pearls were bartered from the natives. A week after the passage of the Dragons Mouth Columbus sighted the south coast of Espanola$ which coast he made at a point a long way to the east of the new settlement that he had instructed Bartholomew to found; and as the winds were contrary$ and he feared it might take him a long time to beat up against them$ he sent a boat ashore with a letter which was to be delivered by a native messenger to the Adelantado. The letter was delivered; a few days later a caravel was sighted which contained Bartholomew himself; and once more$ after a long separation$ these two friends and brothers were united.

Evangelista,San Juan Teotihuacan de Arista $ Mexico,-98.87970290000001,19.6885784,Perhaps in his madness he would really have gone on and tried to reach the Golden Chersonesus of Ptolemy$ which according to Marco Polo lay just beyond$ and so to steer homeward round Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope; in which case he would either have been lost or would have discovered Mexico. The crews$ however$ would not hear of the voyage being continued westward. The ships were leaking and the salt water was spoiling the already doubtful provisions and he was forced to turn back. He stood to the south-east$ and reached the Isle of Pines$ to which he gave the name of Evangelista$ where the water-casks were filled$ and from there he tried to sail back to the east. But he found himself surrounded by islands and banks in every direction$ which made any straight course impossible. He sailed south and east and west and north$ and found himself always back again in the middle of this charmed group of islands. He spent almost a month trying to escape from them$ and once his ship went ashore on a sandbank and was only warped off with the greatest difficulty. On July 7th he was back again in the region of the Queens Gardens$ from which he stood across to the coast of Cuba.
Black,Los Angeles $ United States,-118.3245963,34.0906174,In this faith$ then$ and with this equipment$ and about the year 1465$ Christopher Columbus began his sea travels. His voyages would be doubtless at first much along the coasts$ and across to Alexandria and the Islands. There would be returnings to Genoa$ and glad welcomings by the little household in the narrow street; in 1472 and 1473 he was with his father at Savona$ helping with the wool-weaving and tavern-keeping; possibly also there were interviews with Benincasa$ who was at that time living in Genoa$ and making his famous sea-charts. Perhaps it was in his studio that Christopher first saw a chart$ and first fell in love with the magic that can transfer the shapes of oceans and continents to a piece of paper. Then he would be off again in another ship$ to the Golden Horn perhaps$ or the Black Sea$ for the Genoese had a great Crimean trade. This is all conjecture$ but very reasonable conjecture; what we know for a fact is that he saw the white gum drawn from the lentiscus shrubs in Chio at the time of their flowering; that fragrant memory is preserved long afterwards in his own writings$ evoked by some incident in the newly-discovered islands of the West. There are vague rumours and stories of his having been engaged in various expeditionsamong them one fitted out in Genoa by John of Anjou to recover the kingdom of Naples for King Rene of Provence; but there is no reason to believe these rumours: good reason to disbelieve them$ rather.
Coast,Chicago $ United States,-87.61840649999999,41.8873607,While Diego$ as this son was christened$ was yet only a baby in his cradle$ Columbus made an important voyage to the$ coast of Guinea as all the western part of the African continent was then called. His solid and practical qualities were by this time beginning to be recognised even by Philippas haughty family$ and it was possibly through the interest of her uncle$ Pedro Noronhas$ a distinguished minister of the King of Portugal$ that he got the command of a caravel in the expedition which set out for Guinea in December 1481. A few miles from Cape Coast Castle$ and on the borders of the Dutch colony$ there are to-day the ruined remains of a fort; and it is this fort$ the fortress of St. George$ that the expedition was sent out to erect. On the 11th of December the little fleet set sail for [from? D.W.] Lisbonten caravels$ and two barges or lighters laden with the necessary masonry and timber-work for the fort. Columbus was in command of one of the caravels$ and the whole fleet was commanded by the Portuguese Admiral Azumbaga. They would certainly see Porto Santo and Madeira on their way south$ although they did not call there; and Philippa was no doubt looking out for them$ and watching from the sand-hills the fleet of twelve ships going by in the offing. They called at Cape Verde$ where the Admiral was commissioned to present one of the negro kings with some horses and hawks$ and incidentally to obtain his assent to a treaty. On the 19th of January 1482$ having made a very good voyage$ they$ landed just beyond the Cape of the Three Points$ and immediately set about the business of the expedition.

North,Wichita $ United States,-97.34509100000001,37.709862,This conception of the world excluded the Pacific Ocean and the continent of North and South America$ and made it reasonable to suppose that any one who sailed westward long enough from Spain would ultimately reach Cathay and the Indies. Behaims globe$ which was completed in the year 1492$ represented the farthest point that geographical knowledge had reached previous to the discoveries of Columbus$ and on it is shown the island of Cipango or Japan.
Salamanca,Salamanca $ Spain,-5.663539699999999,40.9701039,From Segovia Columbus followed the Court to Salamanca and thence to Valladolid$ where his increasing illness kept him a prisoner after the Court had left to greet Philip and Juana. He had been in attendance upon it for nearly a year$ and without any results: and now$ as his infirmity increased$ he turned to the settling of his own affairs$ and drawing up of wills and codicilsall very elaborate and precise. In these occupations his worldly affairs were duly rounded off; and on May 19$ 1506$ having finally ratified a will which he had made in Segovia a year before$ in which the descent of his honours was entailed upon Diego and his heirs$ or failing him Ferdinand and his heirs$ or failing him Bartholomew and his heirs$ he turned to the settlement of his soul.
Alhambra,Granada $ Spain,-3.5881413,37.1760783,During all the time that Columbus and his brothers were struggling with the impossible situation at Espanola there was but one influence at work in Spain$ and that was entirely destructive to the Admiral. Every caravel that came from the New World brought two things. It brought a crowd of discontented colonists$ many of whom had grave reasons for their discontent; and it brought letters from the Admiral in which more and more promises were held out$ but in which also querulous complaints against this and that person$ and against the Spanish settlers generally$ were set forth at wearisome length. It is not remarkable that the people of Spain$ even those who were well disposed towards Columbus$ began to wonder if these two things were not cause and effect. The settlers may have been a poor lot$ but they were the material with which Columbus had to deal; he had powers enough$ Heaven knew$ powers of life and death; and the problem began to resolve itself in the minds of those at the head of affairs in Spain in the following terms. Given an island$ rich and luxuriant beyond the dreams of man; given a native population easily subdued; given settlers of one kind or another; and given a Viceroy with unlimited powerscould he or could he not govern the island? It was a by no means unfair way of putting the case$ and there is little justice in the wild abuse that has been hurled at Ferdinand and Isabella on this ground. Columbus may have been the greatest genius in the world; very possibly they admitted it; but in the meanwhile Spain was resounding with the cries of the impoverished colonists who had returned from his ocean Paradise. No doubt the Sovereigns ignored them as much as they possibly could; but when it came to ragged emaciated beggars coming in batches of fifty at a time and sitting in the very courts of the Alhambra$ exhibiting bunches of grapes and saying that that was all they could afford to live upon since they had come back from the New World$ some notice had to be taken of it. Even young Diego and Ferdinand$ the Admirals sons$ came in for the obloquy with which his name was associated; the colonial vagabonds hung round the portals of the palace and cried out upon them as they passed so that they began to dislike going out. Columbus$ as we know$ had plenty of enemies who had access to the King and Queen; and never had enemies an easier case to urge. Money was continually being spent on ships and supplies; where was the return for it? What about the Ophir of Solomon? What about the Land of Spices? What about the pearls? And if you want to add a touch of absurdity$ what about the Garden of Eden and the Great Khan?
Medina,Medina $ Saudi Arabia,39.5691841,24.5246542,It became necessary now to raise a considerable sum of money for the new expedition. Two-thirds of the ecclesiastical tithes were appropriated$ and a large proportion of the confiscated property of the Jews who had been banished from Spain the year before; but this was not enough; and five million maravedis were borrowed from the Duke of Medina Sidonia in order to complete the financial supplies necessary for this very costly expedition. There was a treasurer$ Francisco Pinelo$ and an accountant$ Juan de Soria$ who had charge of all the financial arrangements; but the whole of the preparations were conducted on a ruinously expensive scale$ owing to the haste which the diplomatic relations with Portugal made necessary. The provisioning was done by a Florentine merchant named Juonato Beradi$ who had an assistant named Amerigo Vespucciwho$ by a strange accident$ was afterwards to give his name to the continent of the New World.
Quarto,Quarto $ Italy,14.1452416,40.8784309,In 1450 he bought a pleasant house at Quarto$ a village on the sea-shore about a mile to the west of Quinto and about five miles to the east of Genoa. It was probably a pure speculation$ as he immediately leased the house for two years$ and never lived in it himself$ although it was a pleasant place$ with an orchard of olives and figs and various other treesarboratum olivis ficubus et aliis diversis arboribus. His next recorded transaction is in 1466$ when he went security for a friend$ doubtless with disastrous results. In 1473 he sold the house at the Olive Gate$ that suburban dwelling where probably Christopher was born$ and in 1474 he invested the proceeds of that sale in a piece of land which I have referred to before$ situated in the suburbs of Savona$ with which were sold those agreeable and useless wine-vats. Domenico was living at Savona then$ and the property which he so fatuously acquired consisted of two large pieces of land on the Via Valcalda$ containing a few vines$ a plantation of fruit-trees$ and a large area of shrub and underwood. The price$ however$ was never paid in full$ and was the cause of a lawsuit which dragged on for forty years$ and was finally settled by Don Diego Columbus$ Christophers son$ who sent a special authority from Hispaniola.
Tinto,Philadelphia $ United States,-75.17384489999999,39.9515011,They crossed over to the mainland of Honduras on August 15th$ Bartholomew landing and attending mass on the beach as the Admiral himself was too ill to go ashore. Three days later the cross and banner of Castile were duly erected on the shores of the Rio Tinto and the country was formally annexed. The natives were friendly$ and supplied the ships with provisions; but they were very black and ugly$ and Columbus readily believed the assertion of his native guide that they were cannibals. They continued their course to the eastward$ but as the gulf narrowed the force of the west-going current was felt more severely. Columbus$ believing that the strait which he sought lay to the eastward$ laboured against the current$ and his difficulties were increased by the bad weather which he now encountered. There were squalls and hurricanes$ tempests and cross-currents that knocked his frail ships about and almost swamped them. Anchors and gear were lost$ the sails were torn out of the bolt-ropes$ timbers were strained; and for six weeks this state of affairs went on to an accompaniment of thunder and lightning which added to the terror and discomfort of the mariners.
Casas,San Diego $ United States,-117.1201574,32.8314494, [The substance of these murmurings is not in the abridged Journal$ but is given by Las Casas under the date of September 24.]
Esperanza,Yorba Linda $ United States,-117.7567215,33.87557100000001,It may perhaps be wearisome to the reader to return to the tangled and depressing situation in Espanola$ but it cannot be half so wearisome as it was for Columbus$ whom we left enveloped in that dark cloud of error and surrender in which he sacrificed his dignity and good faith to the impudent demands of a mutinous servant. To his other troubles in San Domingo the presence of this Roldan was now added; and the reinstated Alcalde was not long in making use of the victory he had gained. He bore himself with intolerable arrogance and insolence$ discharging one of Columbuss personal bodyguard on the ground that no one should hold any office on the island except with his consent. He demanded grants of land for himself and his followers$ which Columbus held himself obliged to concede; and the Admiral$ further to pacify him$ invented a very disastrous system of repartimientos$ under which certain chiefs were relieved from paying tribute on condition of furnishing feudal service to the settlersa system which rapidly developed into the most cruel and oppressive kind of slavery. The Admiral at this time also$ in despair of keeping things quiet by his old methods of peace and conciliation$ created a kind of police force which roamed about the island$ exacting tribute and meting out summary punishment to all defaulters. Among other concessions weakly made to Roldan at this time was the gift of the Crown estate of Esperanza$ situated in the Vega Real$ whither he betook himself and embarked on what was nothing more nor less than a despotic reign$ entirely ignoring the regulations and prerogatives of the Admiral$ and taking prisoners and administering punishment just as he pleased. The Admiral was helpless$ and thought of going back to Spain$ but the condition of the island was such that he did not dare to leave it. Instead$ he wrote a long letter to the Sovereigns$ full of complaints against other people and justifications of himself$ in the course of which he set forth those quibbling excuses for his capitulation to Roldan which we have already heard. And there was a pathetic request at the end of the letter that his son Diego might be sent out to him. As I have said$ Columbus was by this time a prematurely old man$ and feeling the clouds gathering about him$ and the loneliness and friendlessness of his position at Espanola$ he instinctively looked to the next generation for help$ and to the presence of his own son for sympathy and comfort.
Seguro,Oildale $ United States,-119.0212119,35.4185688,And finally$ to complete the account of the chief minor discoveries of these two busy years$ we must mention Pedro Alvarez Cabral of Portugal$ who was despatched in March 1$ 1500 from Lisbon to verify the discoveries of Da Gama. He reached Calicut six months later$ losing on the voyage four of his caravels and most of his company. Among the lost was Bartholomew Diaz$ the first discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope$ who was on this voyage in a subordinate capacity$ and whose bones were left to dissolve in the stormy waters that beat round the Cape whose barrier he was the first to pass. The chief event of this voyage$ however$ was not the reaching of Calicut nor the drowning of Diaz (which was chiefly of importance to himself$ poor soul!) but the discovery of Brazil$ which Cabral made in following the southerly course too far to the west. He landed there$ in the Bay of Porto Seguro$ on May 1$ 1500$ and took formal possession of the land for the Crown of Portugal$ naming it Vera Cruz$ or the Land of the True Cross.
Lanzarote,Lanzarote$ Las Palmas$ Spain,-13.5899733,29.0468535,The first mishap occurred on Monday$ August 6th$ when the Pinta carried away her rudder. The Pinta$ it will be remembered$ was commanded by Martin Alonso Pinzon$ and was owned by Gomaz Rascon and Christoval Quintero$ who had been at the bottom of some of the troubles ashore; and it was thought highly probable that these two rascals had something to do with the mishap$ which they had engineered in the hope that their vessel would be left behind at the Canaries. Martin Alonso$ however$ proved a man of resource$ and rigged up a sort of steering gear with ropes. There was a choppy sea$ and Columbus could not bring his own vessel near enough to render any assistance$ though he doubtless bawled his directions to Pinzon$ and looked with a troubled eye on the commotion going on on board the Pinta. On the next day the jury-rigged rudder carried away again$ and was again repaired$ but it was decided to try and make the island of Lanzarote in the Canaries$ and to get another caravel to replace the Pinta. All through the next day the Santa Maria and the Nina had to shorten sail in order not to leave the damaged Pinta behind; the three captains had a discussion and difference of opinion as to where they were; but Columbus$ who was a genius at dead-reckoning$ proved to be right in his surmise$ and they came in sight of the Canaries on Thursday morning$ August 9th.
Long,London $ Canada,-81.3137649,43.0179333,Fernandina was the name which Columbus had already given to Long Island when he sighted it from Santa Maria; and he reached it in the evening of Tuesday$ October 16th. The man in the canoe had arrived before him; and the astute Admiral had the satisfaction of finding that once more his cleverness had been rewarded$ and that the man in the canoe had given such glowing accounts of his generosity that there was no difficulty about his getting water and supplies. While the barrels of water were being filled he landed and strolled about in the pleasant groves$ observing the islanders and their customs$ and finding them on the whole a little more sophisticated than those of San Salvador. The women wore mantillas on their heads and little pieces of cotton round their loinsa sufficiently odd costume; and they appeared to Columbus to be a little more astute than the other islanders$ for though they brought cotton in quantities to the ships they exacted payment of beads for it. In the charm and wonder of his walk in this enchanted land he was able for a moment to forget his hunger for gold and to admire the great branching palm-trees$ and the fish that
Grenada,Grenada,-61.67899999999999,12.1165,On August 11th Columbus turned east again after having given up the attempt to find a passage to the north round Paria. There were practical considerations that brought him to this action. As the water was growing shoaler and shoaler he had sent a caravel of light draft some way further to the westward$ and she reported that there lay ahead of her a great inner bay or gulf consisting of almost entirely fresh water. Provisions$ moreover$ were running short$ and were$ as usual$ turning bad; the Admirals health made vigorous action of any kind impossible for him; he was anxious about the condition of Espanolaanxious also$ as we have seen$ to send this great news home; and he therefore turned back and decided to risk the passage of the Dragons Mouth. He anchored in the neighbouring harbour until the wind was in the right quarter$ and with some trepidation put his ships into the boiling tideway. When they were in the middle of the passage the wind fell to a dead calm$ and the ships$ with their sails hanging loose$ were borne on the dizzy surface of eddies$ overfalls$ and whirls of the tide. Fortunately there was deep water in the passage$ and the strength of the current carried them safely through. Once outside they bore away to the northward$ sighting the islands of Tobago and Grenada and$ turning westward again$ came to the islands of Cubagua and Margarita$ where three pounds of pearls were bartered from the natives. A week after the passage of the Dragons Mouth Columbus sighted the south coast of Espanola$ which coast he made at a point a long way to the east of the new settlement that he had instructed Bartholomew to found; and as the winds were contrary$ and he feared it might take him a long time to beat up against them$ he sent a boat ashore with a letter which was to be delivered by a native messenger to the Adelantado. The letter was delivered; a few days later a caravel was sighted which contained Bartholomew himself; and once more$ after a long separation$ these two friends and brothers were united.
Castle,Valier $ United States,-112.7632429,48.188534,While Diego$ as this son was christened$ was yet only a baby in his cradle$ Columbus made an important voyage to the$ coast of Guinea as all the western part of the African continent was then called. His solid and practical qualities were by this time beginning to be recognised even by Philippas haughty family$ and it was possibly through the interest of her uncle$ Pedro Noronhas$ a distinguished minister of the King of Portugal$ that he got the command of a caravel in the expedition which set out for Guinea in December 1481. A few miles from Cape Coast Castle$ and on the borders of the Dutch colony$ there are to-day the ruined remains of a fort; and it is this fort$ the fortress of St. George$ that the expedition was sent out to erect. On the 11th of December the little fleet set sail for [from? D.W.] Lisbonten caravels$ and two barges or lighters laden with the necessary masonry and timber-work for the fort. Columbus was in command of one of the caravels$ and the whole fleet was commanded by the Portuguese Admiral Azumbaga. They would certainly see Porto Santo and Madeira on their way south$ although they did not call there; and Philippa was no doubt looking out for them$ and watching from the sand-hills the fleet of twelve ships going by in the offing. They called at Cape Verde$ where the Admiral was commissioned to present one of the negro kings with some horses and hawks$ and incidentally to obtain his assent to a treaty. On the 19th of January 1482$ having made a very good voyage$ they$ landed just beyond the Cape of the Three Points$ and immediately set about the business of the expedition.
Calais,Calais $ France,1.858686,50.95129000000001,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Cibao,Cibao$ Camuy$ Puerto Rico,-66.8766904,18.373375,Columbus immediately despatched Bartholomew with a party to examine the mines; and sure enough they found in the river Hayna undoubted evidence of a wealth far in excess of that contained in the Cibao gold-mines. Moreover$ they had noticed two ancient excavations about which the natives could tell them nothing$ but which made them think that the mines had once been worked.
Sidonia,Sidonia$ TN 38255$ USA,-88.90589609999999,36.2439542,It became necessary now to raise a considerable sum of money for the new expedition.

Catalina,Santa Catalina Island$ California 90704$ USA,-118.4163103,33.3878856,Sir$The loneliness in which you have left us cannot be described. I gave the book containing my writings to Francisco de Rivarol that he may send it to you with another copy of letters containing instructions. I beg you to be so kind as to write Don Diego in regard to the place of security in which you put them. Duplicates of everything will be completed and sent to you in the same manner and by the same Francisco. Among them you will find a new document. Their Highnesses promised to give all that belongs to me and to place Don Diego in possession of everything$ as you will see. I wrote to Senor Juan Luis and to Sefora Catalina. The letter accompanies this one. I am ready to start in the name of the Holy Trinity as soon as the weather is good. I am well provided with everything. If Jeronimo de Santi Esteban is coming$ he must await me and not embarrass himself with anything$ for they will take away from him all they can and silently leave him. Let him come here and the King and the Queen will receive him until I come. May our Lord have you in His holy keeping.
Bueno,Tulsa $ United States,-95.94858099999999,36.147421,Their six days sojourn amid the Queens Gardens$ then$ was not a great success; and as soon as they were able they set sail again$ standing eastward when the wind permitted them. But wind and current were against them and all through the month of May and the early part of June they struggled along the south coast of Cuba$ their ships as full of holes as a honeycomb$ pumps going incessantly$ and in addition the worn-out seamen doing heroic labour at baling with buckets and kettles. Lee helm! Down go the buckets and kettles and out run the wretched scarecrows of seamen to the weary business of tacking ship$ letting go$ brailing up$ hauling in$ and making fast for the thousandth time; and then back to the pumps and kettles again. No human being could endure this for an indefinite time; and though their diet of worms represented by the rotten biscuit was varied with cassava bread supplied by friendly natives$ the Admiral could not make his way eastward further than Cape Cruz. Round that cape his leaking$ strained vessels could not be made to look against the wind and the tide. Could hardly indeed be made to float or swim upon the water at all; and the Admiral had now to consider$ not whether he could sail on a particular point of the compass$ but whether he could by any means avoid another course which the fates now proposed to himnamely$ a perpendicular course to the bottom of the sea. It was a race between the water and the ships$ and the only thing the Admiral could think of was to turn southward across to Jamaica$ which he did on June 23rd$ putting into Puerto Bueno$ now called Dry Harbour. But there was no food there$ and as his ships were settling deeper and deeper in the water he had to make sail again and drive eastwards as far as Puerto Santa Gloria$ now called Don Christophers Cove. He was just in time. The ships were run ashore side by side on a sandy beach$ the pumps were abandoned$ and in one tide the ships were full of water. The remaining anchor cables were used to lash the two ships together so that they would not move; although there was little fear of that$ seeing the weight of water that was in them. Everything that could be saved was brought up on deck$ and a kind of cabin or platform which could be fortified was rigged on the highest part of the ships. And so no doubt for some days$ although their food was almost finished$ the wretched and exhausted voyagers could stretch their cramped limbs$ and rest in the warm sun$ and listen$ from their safe haven on the firm sands$ to the hated voice of the sea.
Equator,Equator$ Democratic Republic of the Congo,20.3308814,0.5640035999999999,The world that Columbus had heard about as being within the knowledge of men extended on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia$ on the south to a cape one hundred miles south of the Equator$ and to the east as far as China and Japan. North and South were not important to the spirit of that time; it was East and West that men thought of when they thought of the expansion and the discovery of the world. And although they admitted that the earth was a sphere$ I think it likely that they imagined (although the imagination was contrary to their knowledge) that the line of West and East was far longer$ and full of vaster possibilities$ than that of North and South. North was familiar ground to themone voyage to England$ another to Iceland$ another to Scandinavia; there was nothing impossible about that. Southward was another matter; but even here there was no ambition to discover the limit of the world. It is an error continually made by the biographers of Columbus that the purpose of Prince Henrys explorations down the coast of Africa was to find a sea road to the West Indies by way of the East. It was nothing of the kind. There was no idea in the minds of the Portuguese of the land which Columbus discovered$ and which we now know as the West Indies. Mr. Vignaud contends that the confusion arose from the very loose way in which the term India was applied in the Middle Ages. Several Indias were recognised. There was an India beyond the Ganges; a Middle India between the Ganges and the Indus; and a Lesser India$ in which were included Arabia$ Abyssinia$ and the countries about the Red Sea. These divisions were$ however$ quite vague$ and varied in different periods. In the time of Columbus the word India meant the kingdom of Prester John$ that fabulous monarch who had been the subject of persistent legends since the twelfth century; and it was this India to which the Portuguese sought a sea road. They had no idea of a barrier cape far to the south$ the doubling of which would open a road for them to the west; nor were they$ as Mr. Vignaud believes$ trying to open a route for the spice trade with the Orient. They had no great spice trade$ and did not seek more; what they did seek was an extension of their ordinary trade with Guinea and the African coast. To the maritime world of the fifteenth century$ then$ the South as a geographical region and as a possible point of discovery had no attractions.
Marigalante,Puerto Vallarta $ Mexico,-105.2340487,20.6121445,The Admiral sailed on March 10th$ 1496$ carrying with him in chains the vanquished Caonabo and other natives. He touched at Marigalante and at Guadaloupe$ where his people had an engagement with the natives$ taking several prisoners$ but releasing them all again with the exception of one woman$ a handsome creature who had fallen in love with Caonabo and refused to go. But for Caonabo the joys of life and love were at an end; his heart and spirit were broken. He was not destined to be paraded as a captive through the streets of Spain$ and it was somewhere in the deep Atlantic that he paid the last tribute to the power that had captured and broken him. He died on the voyage$ which was longer and much more full of hardships than usual. For some reason or other Columbus did not take the northerly route going home$ but sailed east from Gaudaloupe$ encountering the easterly trade winds$ which delayed him so much that the voyage occupied three months instead of six weeks.
Africa,Africa,34.508523,-8.783195,He saw another peak of the mainland to the northwest$ which was the peninsula of Paria$ and to which Columbus$ taking it to be another island$ gave the name of Isla de Gracia. Between him and this land lay a narrow channel through which a mighty current was flowingthat press of waters which$ sweeping across the Atlantic from Africa$ enters the Caribbean Sea$ sprays round the Gulf of Mexico$ and turns north again in the current known as the Gulf Stream. While his ships were anchored at the entrance to this channel and Columbus was wondering how he should cross it$ a mighty flood of water suddenly came down with a roar$ sending a great surging wave in front of it. The vessels were lifted up as though by magic; two of them dragged their anchors from the bottom$ and the other one broke her cable. This flood was probably caused by a sudden flush of fresh water from one of the many mouths of the Orinoco; but to Columbus$ who had no thought of rivers in his mind$ it was very alarming. Apparently$ however$ there was nothing for it but to get through the channel$ and having sent boats on in front to take soundings and see that there was clear water he eventually piloted his little squadron through$ with his heart in his mouth and his eyes fixed on the swinging eddies and surging circles of the channel. Once beyond it he was in the smooth water of the Gulf of Paria. He followed the westerly coast of Trinidad to the north until he came to a second channel narrower than the first$ through which the current boiled with still greater violence$ and to which he gave the name of Dragons Mouth. This is the channel between the northwesterly point of Trinidad and the eastern promontory of Paria. Columbus now began to be bewildered$ for he discovered that the water over the ships side was fresh water$ and he could not make out where it came from. Thinking that the peninsula of Paria was an island$ and not wishing to attempt the dangerous passage of the Dragons Mouth$ he decided to coast along the southern shore of the land opposite$ hoping to be able to turn north round its western extremity.
Konigsberg,Kaliningrad $ Russia,20.4522144,54.7104264,There is absolutely no record of his circumstances in the first year of his life at Lisbon$ so we may look once more into the glass of imagination and try to find a picture there. It is very dim$ very minute$ very$ very far away. There is the little shop in a steep Lisbon street$ somewhere near the harbour we may be sure$ with the shadows of the houses lying sharp on the white sunlight of the street; the cool darkness of the shop$ with its odour of vellum and parchment$ its rolls of maps and charts; and somewhere near by the sounds and commotion of the wharves and the shipping. Often$ when there was a purchaser in the shop$ there would be talk of the sea$ of the best course from this place to that$ of the entrance to this harbour and the other; talk of the western islands too$ of the western ocean$ of the new astrolabe which the German Muller of Konigsberg$ or Regiomontanus$ as they called him in Portugal$ had modified and improved. And if there was sometimes an evening walk$ it would surely be towards the coast or on a hill above the harbour$ with a view of the sun being quenched in the sea and travelling down into the unknown$ uncharted West.
Babeque,Santo Domingo $ Dominican Republic,-69.9305603,18.4699659,The local chief came on a visit of state to the ship; and the Admiral paid him due honour$ telling him that he came as an envoy from the greatest sovereigns in the world. But this charming king$ or cacique as they called him$ would not believe this; he thought that Columbus was$ for reasons of modesty$ speaking less than the trutha new charge to bring against our Christopher! He believed that the Spaniards came from heaven$ and that the realms of the sovereigns of Castile were in the heavens and not in this world. He took some refreshment$ as his councillors did also$ little dreaming$ poor wretches$ what in after years was to come to them through all this palavering and exchanging of presents. The immediate result of the interview$ however$ was to make intercourse with the natives much freer and pleasanter even than it had been before; and some of the sailors went fishing with the natives. It was then that they were shown some cane arrows with hardened points$ which the natives said belonged to the people of Caniba$ who$ they alleged$ came to the island to capture and eat the natives. The Admiral did not believe it; his sublime habit of rejecting everything that did not fit in with his theory of the moment$ and accepting everything that did$ made him shake his head when this piece of news was brought to him. He could not get the Great Khan out of his head$ and his present theory was that this island$ being close to the mainland of Cathay$ was visited by the armies of the Great Khan$ and that it was his men who had used the arrows and made war upon the natives. It was no good for the natives to show him some of their mutilated bodies$ and to tell him that the cannibals ate them piecemeal; he had no use for such information. His mind was like a sieve of which the size of the meshes could be adjusted at will; everything that was not germane to the idea of the moment fell through it$ and only confirmative evidence remained; and at the moment he was not believing any stories which did not prove that the Great Khan was$ so to speak$ just round the corner. If they talked about gold he would listen to them; and so the cacique brought him a piece of gold the size of his hand and$ breaking it into pieces$ gave it to him a bit at a time. This the Admiral took to be sign of great intelligence. They told him there was gold at Tortuga$ but he preferred to believe that it came from Babeque$ which may have been Jamaica and may have been nothing at all.
Britain,Britain $ United States,-77.69722,39.25278,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Pinta,Pinta$ AZ 86502$ USA,-109.630668,35.0822462,A great quantity of birds that began to fly about the ship made him think that they were near land$ but they turned out to be the harbingers of a storm. On Tuesday$ February 12th$ the sea and wind began to rise$ and it continued to blow harder throughout that night and the next day. The wind being aft he went under bare poles most of the night$ and when day came hoisted a little sail; but the sea was terrible$ and if he had not been so sure of the staunch little Nina he would have felt himself in danger of being lost. The next day the sea$ instead of going down$ increased in roughness; there was a heavy cross sea which kept breaking right over the ship$ and it became necessary to make a little sail in order to run before the wind$ and to prevent the vessel falling back into the trough of the seas. All through Thursday he ran thus under the half hoisted staysail$ and he could see the Pinta running also before the wind$ although since she presented more surface$ and was able to carry a little more sail than the Nina$ she was soon lost to sight. The Admiral showed lights through the night$ and this time there was no lack of response from Martin Alonso; and for some part of that dark and stormy night these two humanly freighted scraps of wood and cordage staggered through the gale showing lights to each other; until at last the light from the Pinta disappeared. When morning came she was no longer to be seen; and the wind and the sea had if anything increased. The Nina was now in the greatest danger. Any one wave of the heavy cross sea$ if it had broken fairly across her$ would have sunk her; and she went swinging and staggering down into the great valleys and up into the hills$ the steersmans heart in his mouth$ and the whole crew in an extremity of fear. Columbus$ who generally relied upon his seamanship$ here invoked external aid$ and began to offer bargains to the Almighty. He ordered that lots should be cast$ and that he upon whom the lot fell should make a vow to go on pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Guadaloupe carrying a white candle of five pounds weight. Same dried peas were brought$ one for every member of the crew$ and on one of them a cross was marked with a knife; the peas were well shaken and were put into a cap. The first to draw was the Admiral; he drew the marked pea$ and he made the vow. Lots were again drawn$ this time for a greater pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Loretto in Ancona; and the lot fell on a seaman named Pedro de Villa$the expenses of whose pilgrimage Columbus promised to pay. Again lots were drawn for a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Clara of Moguer$ the pilgrim to watch and pray for one night there; and again the lot fell on Columbus. In addition to these$ every one$ since they took themselves for lost$ made some special and private vow or bargain with God; and finally they all made a vow together that at the first land they reached they would go in procession in their shirts to pray at an altar of Our Lady.

It is true there were rumours that the whole fleet had perished$ for it encountered a gale very soon after leaving Cadiz$ and a great quantity of the deck hamper was thrown overboard and was washed on the shores of Spain; and the Sovereigns were so bitterly distressed that$ as it is said$ they shut them selves up for eight days. News eventually came$ however$ that only one ship had been lost and that the rest had proceeded safely to San Domingo. Columbus$ much recovered in body and mind$ now began to apply for a fleet for himself. He had heard of the discovery by the Portuguese of the southern route to India; no doubt he had heard also much gossip of the results of the many private voyages of discovery that were sailing from Spain at this time; and he began to think seriously about his own discoveries and the way in which they might best be extended. He thought much of his voyage to the west of Trinidad and of the strange pent-up seas and currents that he had discovered there. He remembered the continual westward trend of the current$ and how all the islands in that sea had their greatest length east and west$ as though their shores had been worn into that shape by the constant flowing of the current; and it was not an unnatural conclusion for him to suppose that there was a channel far to the west through which these seas poured and which would lead him to the Golden Chersonesus. He put away from him that nightmare madness that he transacted on the coast of Cuba. He knew very well that he had not yet found the Golden Chersonesus and the road to India; but he became convinced that the western current would lead him there if only he followed it long enough. There was nothing insane about this theory; it was in fact a very well-observed and well-reasoned argument; and the fact that it happened to be entirely wrong is no reflection on the Admirals judgment. The great Atlantic currents at that time had not been studied; and how could he know that the western stream of water was the northern half of a great ocean current which sweeps through the Caribbean Sea$ into and round the Gulf of Mexico$ and flows out northward past Florida in the Gulf Stream?
Ojeda,Dallas $ United States,-96.8249589,32.8128697,It was at this moment (September 5$ 1499) that a diversion arose in the rumour that four caravels had been seen off the western end of Espanola and duly reported to the Admiral; and this announcement was soon followed by the news that they were commanded by Ojeda$ who was collecting dye-wood in the island forests. Columbus$ although he had so far as we know had no previous difficulties with Ojeda$ had little cause now to credit any adventurer with kindness towards himself; and Ojedas secrecy in not reporting himself at San Domingo$ and$ in fact$ his presence on the island at all without the knowledge of the Admiral$ were sufficient evidence that he was there to serve his own ends. Some gleam of Christophers old cleverness in handling men wasnow shown by his instructing Roldan to sally forth and bring Ojeda to order. It was a case of setting a thief to catch a thief and$ as it turned out$ was not a bad stroke. Roldan$ nothing loth$ sailed round to that part of the coast where Ojedas ships were anchored$ and asked to see his licence; which was duly shown to him and rather took the wind out of his sails. He heard a little gossip from Ojeda$ moreover$ which had its own significance for him. The Queen was ill; Columbus was in disgrace; there was talk of superseding him. Ojeda promised to sail round to San Domingo and report himself; but instead$ he sailed to the east along the coast of Xaragua$ where he got into communication with some discontented Spanish settlers and concocted a scheme for leading them to San Domingo to demand redress for their imagined grievances. Roldan$ however$ who had come to look for Ojeda$ discovered him at this point; and there ensued some very pretty play between the two rascals$ chiefly in trickery and treachery$ such as capturing each others boats and emissaries$ laying traps for one another$ and taking prisoner one anothers crews. The end of it was that Ojeda left the island without having reported himself to Columbus$ but not before he had completed his businesswhich was that of provisioning his ships and collecting dye-wood and slaves.
Funchal,Funchal $ Portugal,-16.9240554,32.6669328,Columbus was at sea again; firm ground to him$ although so treacherous and unstable to most of us; and as he saw the Spanish coast sinking down on the horizon he could shake himself free from his troubles$ and feel that once more he was in a situation of which he was master. He first touched at Porto Santo$ where$ if the story of his residence there be true$ there must have been potent memories for him in the sight of the long white beach and the plantations$ with the Governors house beyond. He stayed there only a few hours and then crossed over to Madeira$ anchoring in the Bay of Funchal$ where he took in wood and water. As it was really unnecessary for him to make a port so soon after leaving$ there was probably some other reason for his visit to these islands; perhaps a family reason; perhaps nothing more historically important than the desire to look once more on scenes of bygone happiness$ for even on the page of history every event is not necessarily big with significance. From Madeira he took a southerly course to the Canary Islands$ and on June 16th anchored at Gomera$ where he found a French warship with two Spanish prizes$ all of which put to sea as the Admirals fleet approached. On June 21st$ when he sailed from Gomera$ he divided his fleet of six vessels into two squadrons. Three ships were despatched direct to Espanola$ for the supplies which they carried were urgently needed there. These three ships were commanded by trustworthy men: Pedro de Arana$ a brother of Beatriz$ Alonso Sanchez de Carvajal$ and Juan Antonio Colombothis last no other than a cousin of Christophers from Genoa. The sons of Domenicos provident younger brother had not prospered$ while the sons of improvident Domenico were now all in high places; and these three poor cousins$ hearing of Christophers greatness$ and deciding that use should be made of him$ scraped together enough money to send one of their number to Spain. The Admiral always had a sound family feeling$ and finding that cousin Antonio had sea experience and knew how to handle a ship he gave him command of one of the caravels on this voyagea command of which he proved capable and worthy. From these three captains$ after giving them full sailing directions for reaching Espanola$ Columbus parted company off the island of Ferro. He himself stood on a southerly course towards the Cape Verde Islands.

COLUMBUS,Columbus $ United States,-82.99879419999999,39.9611755,CHAPTER X. THE MAN COLUMBUS
Granada,Granada $ Spain,-3.5985571,37.1773363,These preparations were not made all at once; and it was more than a year after the return of Columbus before Ovando was ready to sail. In the meantime Columbus was living in Granada$ and looking on with no very satisfied eye at the plans which were being made to supersede him$ and about which he was probably not very much consulted; feeling very sore indeed$ and dividing his attention between the nursing of his grievances and other even less wholesome occupations. There was any amount of smiling kindness for him at Court$ but very little of the satisfaction that his vanity and ambition craved; and in the absence of practical employment he fell back on visionary speculations. He made great friends at this time with a monk named Gaspar Gorricio$ with whose assistance he began to make some kind of a study of such utterances of the Prophets and the Fathers as he conceived to have a bearing on his own career.
Sargasso,Morgantown $ United States,-79.97062729999999,39.6120282,On setting his course from Ferro Columbus issued sealed instructions to the captain of each ship which$ in the event of the fleet becoming scattered$ would guide them to the harbour of La Navidad in Espanola; but the captains had strict orders not to open these instructions unless their ships became separated from the fleet$ as Columbus still wished to hold for himself the secret of this mysterious road to the west. There were no disasters$ however$ and no separations. The trade wind blew soft and steady$ wafting them south and west; and because of the more southerly course steered on this voyage they did not even encounter the weed of the Sargasso Sea$ which they left many leagues on their starboard hand. The only incident of the voyage was a sudden severe hurricane$ a brief summer tempest which raged throughout one night and terrified a good many of the voyagers$ whose superstitious fears were only allayed when they saw the lambent flames of the light of Saint Elmo playing about the rigging of the Admirals ship. It was just the Admirals luck that this phenomenon should be observed over his ship and over none of the others; it added to his prestige as a person peculiarly favoured by the divine protection$ and confirmed his own belief that he held a heavenly as well as a royal commission.
Eldorado,Reno $ United States,-119.8149948,39.5294336,The loiterers about the harbour of Cadiz saw a curious sight on June 11th$ 1496$ when the two battered ships$ bearing back the voyagers from the Eldorado of the West$ disembarked their passengers. There were some 220 souls on board$ including thirty Indians: and instead of leaping ashore$ flushed with health$ and bringing the fortunes which they had gone out to seek$ they crawled miserably from the boats or were carried ashore$ emaciated by starvation$ yellow with disease$ ragged and unkempt from poverty$ and with practically no possessions other than the clothes they stood up in. Even the Admiral$ now in his forty-sixth year$ hardly had the appearance that one would expect in a Viceroy of the Indies. His white hair and beard were rough and matted$ his handsome face furrowed by care and sunken by illness and exhaustion$ and instead of the glittering armour and uniform of his office he wore the plain robe and girdle of the Franciscan orderthis last probably in consequence of some vow or other he had made in an hour of peril on the voyage.
Concepcion,Concepción $ Chile,-73.0443904,-36.8201352,Christopher at Fort Concepcion had early news of the arrival of Bobadilla$ but in the hazy state of his mind he did not regard it as an event of sufficient importance to make his immediate presence at San Domingo advisable. The name of Bobadilla conveyed nothing to him; and when he heard that he had come to investigate$ he thought that he came to set right some disputed questions between the Admiral and other navigators as to the right of visiting Espanola and the Paria coast. As the days went on$ however$ he heard more disquieting rumours; grew at last uneasy$ and moved to a fort nearer San Domingo in case it should be necessary for him to go there. An officer met him on the road bearing the proclamations issued by Bobadilla$ but not the message from the Sovereigns requiring the Admirals obedience to the commissioner. Columbus wrote to the commissioner a curious letter$ which is not preserved$ in which he sought to gain time; excusing himself from responsibility for the condition of the island$ and assuring Bobadilla that$ as he intended to return to Spain almost immediately$ he (Bobadilla) would have ample opportunity for exercising his command in his absence. He also wrote to the Franciscan friars who had accompanied Bobadilla asking them to use their influencethe Admiral having some vague connection with the Franciscan order since his days at La Rabida.
Espanola,Española $ United States,-106.0818233,35.9910383,There is playful reference here to Fonseca$ with whom Columbus was evidently now reconciled; and he was to be buttonholed and made to read the Admirals letter to the Pope. Diego Mendez is about to start$ and is to make a long statement; and in the meantime the Admiral will write as many long letters as he has time for. Was there no friend at hand$ I wonder$ with wit enough to tell the Admiral that every word he wrote about his grievances was sealing his doom$ so far as the King was concerned? No human being could have endured with patience this continuous heavy firing at long range to which the Admiral subjected his friends at Court; every post that arrived was loaded with a shrapnel of grievances$ the dull echo of which must have made the ears of those who heard it echo with weariness. Things were evidently humming in Espanola; large cargoes of negroes had been sent out to take the place of the dead natives$ and under the harsh driving of Ovando the mines were producing heavily. The vessels that arrived from the Indies brought a great deal of gold; but none for me.
Ferdinand,Ferdinand $ United States,-86.86218029999999,38.2235908,During all the time that Columbus and his brothers were struggling with the impossible situation at Espanola there was but one influence at work in Spain$ and that was entirely destructive to the Admiral. Every caravel that came from the New World brought two things. It brought a crowd of discontented colonists$ many of whom had grave reasons for their discontent; and it brought letters from the Admiral in which more and more promises were held out$ but in which also querulous complaints against this and that person$ and against the Spanish settlers generally$ were set forth at wearisome length. It is not remarkable that the people of Spain$ even those who were well disposed towards Columbus$ began to wonder if these two things were not cause and effect. The settlers may have been a poor lot$ but they were the material with which Columbus had to deal; he had powers enough$ Heaven knew$ powers of life and death; and the problem began to resolve itself in the minds of those at the head of affairs in Spain in the following terms. Given an island$ rich and luxuriant beyond the dreams of man; given a native population easily subdued; given settlers of one kind or another; and given a Viceroy with unlimited powerscould he or could he not govern the island? It was a by no means unfair way of putting the case$ and there is little justice in the wild abuse that has been hurled at Ferdinand and Isabella on this ground. Columbus may have been the greatest genius in the world; very possibly they admitted it; but in the meanwhile Spain was resounding with the cries of the impoverished colonists who had returned from his ocean Paradise. No doubt the Sovereigns ignored them as much as they possibly could; but when it came to ragged emaciated beggars coming in batches of fifty at a time and sitting in the very courts of the Alhambra$ exhibiting bunches of grapes and saying that that was all they could afford to live upon since they had come back from the New World$ some notice had to be taken of it. Even young Diego and Ferdinand$ the Admirals sons$ came in for the obloquy with which his name was associated; the colonial vagabonds hung round the portals of the palace and cried out upon them as they passed so that they began to dislike going out. Columbus$ as we know$ had plenty of enemies who had access to the King and Queen; and never had enemies an easier case to urge. Money was continually being spent on ships and supplies; where was the return for it? What about the Ophir of Solomon? What about the Land of Spices? What about the pearls? And if you want to add a touch of absurdity$ what about the Garden of Eden and the Great Khan?
Atlantic,Atlantic $ United States,-95.0138776,41.4036007,There was something great and heroic about the Admirals last voyage. Wind and sea rose up as though to make a last bitter attack upon the man who had disclosed their mysteries and betrayed their secrets. He had hardly cleared the island before the first gale came down upon him and dismasted his ship$ so that he was obliged to transfer himself and his son to Bartholomews caravel and send the disabled vessel back to Espanola. The shouting sea$ as though encouraged by this triumph$ hurled tempest after tempest upon the one lonely small ship that was staggering on its way to Spain; and the duel between this great seaman and the vast elemental power that he had so often outwitted began in earnest. One little ship$ one enfeebled man to be destroyed by the power of the sea: that was the problem$ and there were thousands of miles of sea-room$ and two months of time to solve it in! Tempest after tempest rose and drove unceasingly against the ship. A mast was sprung and had to be cut away; another$ and the woodwork from the forecastles and high stern works had to be stripped and lashed round the crazy mainmast to preserve it from wholesale destruction. Another gale$ and the mast had to be shortened$ for even reinforced as it was it would not bear the strain; and so crippled$ so buffeted$ this very small ship leapt and staggered on her way across the Atlantic$ keeping her bowsprit pointed to that region of the foamy emptiness where Spain was.
Venezuela,Venezuela,-66.58973,6.42375,This proposal was too tempting to be refused; unlike the expeditions of Columbus$ which were all expenditure and no revenue$ it promised a chance of revenue without any expenditure at all. The Paria coast$ having been discovered subsequent to the agreement made with Columbus$ was considered by Fonseca to be open to private enterprise; and he therefore granted Ojeda a licence to go and explore it. Among those who went with him were Amerigo Vespucci and Columbuss old pilot$ Juan de la Cosa$ as well as some of the sailors who had been with the Admiral on the coast of Paria and had returned in the caravels which had brought his account of it back to Spain. Ojeda sailed on May 20$ 1499; made a landfall some hundreds of miles to the eastward of the Orinoco$ coasted thence as far as the island of Trinidad$ and sailed along the northern coast of the peninsula of Paria until he came to a country where the natives built their hots on piles in the water$ and to which he gave the name of Venezuela. It was by his accidental presence on this voyage that Vespucci$ the meat-contractor$ came to give his name to Americaa curious story of international jealousies$ intrigues$ lawsuits$ and lies which we have not the space to deal with here. After collecting a considerable quantity of pearls Ojeda$ who was beginning to run short of provisions$ turned eastward again and sought the coast of Espanola$ where we shall presently meet with him again.
Naples,Naples $ Italy,14.2681244,40.8517746,Fickle Spain had already forgotten its first sentimental enthusiasm over the Admirals discoveries$ and now was only interested in their financial results. People cannot be continually excited about a thing which they have not seen$ and there were events much nearer home that absorbed the public interest. There was the trouble with France$ the contemplated alliance of the Crown Prince with Margaret of Austria$ and of the Spanish Princess Juana with Philip of Austria; and there were the designs of Ferdinand upon the kingdom of Naples$ which was in his eyes a much more desirable and valuable prize than any group of unknown islands beyond the ocean.
Navidad,Navidad$ TX 77957$ USA,-96.7691462,29.0655358,But he was not yet beaten. He decided upon another and much larger enterprise$ which was to induce the other caciques of the island to co-operate with him in an attack upon Isabella$ the population of which he knew would have been much thinned and weakened by disease. The island was divided into five native provinces. The northeastern part$ named Marien$ was under the rule of Guacanagari$ whose headquarters were near the abandoned La Navidad. The remaining eastern part of the island$ called Higuay$ was under a chief named Cotabanama. The western province was Xaragua$ governed by one Behechio$ whose sister$ Anacaona$ was the wife of Caonabo. The middle of the island was divided into two provinces-that which extended from the northern coast to the Cibao mountains and included the Vega Real being governed by Guarionex$ and that which extended from the Cibao mountains to the south being governed by Caonabo. All these rulers were more or less embittered by the outrages and cruelties of the Spaniards$ and all agreed to join with Caonabo except Guacanagari. That loyal soul$ so faithful to what he knew of good$ shocked and distressed as he was by outrages from which his own people had suffered no less than the others$ could not bring himself to commit what he regarded as a breach of the laws of hospitality. It was upon his shores that Columbus had first landed; and although it was his own country and his own people whose wrongs were to be avenged$ he could not bring himself to turn traitor to the grave Admiral with whom$ in those happy days of the past$ he had enjoyed so much pleasant intercourse. His refusal to co-operate delayed the plan of Caonabo$ who directed the island coalition against Guacanagari himself in order to bring him to reason. He was attacked by the neighbouring chiefs; one of his wives was killed and another captured; but still he would not swerve from his ideal of conduct.
Ozama,Rio Ozama$ Dominican Republic,-69.89620959999999,18.6675063,At this moment$ while he was waiting for the ship to be completed$ Columbus heard a piece of news of a kind that never failed to rouse his interest. There was a young Spaniard named Miguel Diaz who had got into disgrace in Isabella some time before on account of a duel$ and had wandered into the island until he had come out on the south coast at the mouth of the river Ozama$ near the site of the present town of Santo Domingo. There he had fallen in love with a female cacique and had made his home with her. She$ knowing the Spanish taste$ and anxious to please her lover and to retain him in her territory$ told him of some rich gold-mines that there were in the neighbourhood$ and suggested that he should inform the Admiral$ who would perhaps remove the settlement from Isabella to the south coast. She provided him with guides and sent him off to Isabella$ where$ hearing that his antagonist had recovered$ and that he himself was therefore in no danger of punishment$ he presented himself with his story.
Iceland,Iceland,-19.020835,64.963051,The reasons for doubting that this voyage took place are due simply to Columbuss habit of being untruthful in regard to his own past doings$ and his propensity for drawing the long bow; and the reason that has been accepted by most of his biographers who have denied the truth of this statement is that$ in the year 1492$ when Columbus was addressing the King and Queen of Spain on his qualifications as a navigator$ and when he wished to set forth his experience in a formidable light$ he said nothing about this voyage$ but merely described his explorations as having extended from Guinea on the south to England on the north. A shrewd estimate of Columbuss character makes it indeed seem incredible that$ if he had really been in Iceland$ he should not have mentioned the fact on this occasion; and yet there is just one reason$ also quite characteristic of Columbus$ that would account for the suppression. It is just possible that when he was at Thule$ by which he meant Iceland$ he may have heard of the explorations in the direction of Greenland and Newfoundland; and that$ although by other navigators these lands were regarded as a part of the continent of Europe$ he may have had some glimmerings of an idea that they were part of land and islands in the West; and he was much too jealous of his own reputation as the great and only originator of the project for voyaging to the West$ to give away any hints that he was not the only person to whom such ideas had occurred. There is deception and untruth somewhere; and one must make ones choice between regarding the story in the first place as a lie$ or accepting it as truth$ and putting down Columbuss silence about it on a later occasion to a rare instinct of judicious suppression. There are other facts in his life$ to which$ we shall come later$ that are in accordance with this theory. There is no doubt$ moreover$ that Columbus had a very great experience of the sea$ and was one of the greatest practical seamen$ if not the greatest$ that has ever lived; and it would be foolish to deny$ except for the greatest reasons$ that he made a voyage to the far North$ which was neither unusual at the time nor a very great achievement for a seaman of his experience.

Susanna$ who had been the witness of his melancholy transactions for so many years$ and possibly the mainstay of that declining household$ died in 1494; but not$ we may hope$ before she had heard of the fame of her son Christopher. Domenico$ in receipt of a pension from the famous Admiral of the Ocean$ and no doubt talking with a deal of pride and inaccuracy about the discovery of the New World$ lived on until 1498; when he died also$ and vanished out of this world.

Stefano,Temple Terrace $ United States,-82.393731,28.027953,Here$ then$ between the narrow little house by the Gate and the clamour and business of the sea-front$ our Christophers feet carried him daily during some part of his childish life. What else he did$ what he thought and felt$ what little reflections he had$ are but matters of conjecture. Genoa will tell you nothing more. You may walk over the very spot where he was born; you may unconsciously tread in the track of his vanished feet; you may wander about the wharves of the city$ and see the ships loading and unloadingdifferent ships$ but still trafficking in commodities not greatly different from those of his day; you may climb the heights behind Genoa$ and look out upon the great curving Gulf from Porto Fino to where the Cape of the western Riviera dips into the sea; you may walk along the coast to Savona$ where Domenico had one of his many habitations$ where he kept the tavern$ and whither Christophers young feet must also have walked; and you may come back and search again in the harbour$ from the old Mole and the Bank of St. George to where the port and quays stretch away to the medley of sailing-ships and steamers; but you will not find any sign or trace of Christopher. No echo of the little voice that shrilled in the narrow street sounds in the Vico Dritto; the houses stand gaunt and straight$ with a brilliant strip of blue sky between their roofs and the cool street beneath; but they give you nothing of what you seek. If you see a little figure running towards you in a blue smock$ the head fair-haired$ the face blue-eyed and a little freckled with the strong sunshine$ it is not a real figure; it is a child of your dreams and a ghost of the past. You may chase him while he runs about the wharves and stumbles over the ropes$ but you will never catch him. He runs before you$ zigzagging over the cobbles$ up the sunny street$ into the narrow house; out again$ running now towards the Duomo$ hiding in the porch of San Stefano$ where the weavers held their meetings; back again along the wharves; surely he is hiding behind that mooring-post! But you look$ and he is not therenothing but the old harbour dust that the wind stirs into a little eddy while you look. For he belongs not to you or me$ this child; he is not yet enslaved to the great purpose$ not yet caught up into the machinery of life. His eye has not yet caught the fire of the sun setting on a western sea; he is still free and happy$ and belongs only to those who love him. Father and mother$ brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo$ sister Biancinetta$ aunts$ uncles$ and cousins possibly$ and possibly for a little while an old grandmother at Quintothese were the people to whom that child belonged. The little life of his first decade$ unviolated by documents or history$ lives happily in our dreams$ as blank as sunshine.
Germany,Germany,10.451526,51.165691,From the moment when Columbus set foot on Spanish soil in the spring of 1493 he was surrounded by a fame and glory which$ although they were transient$ were of a splendour such as few other men can have ever experienced. He had not merely discovered a country$ he had discovered a world. He had not merely made a profitable expedition; he had brought the promise of untold wealth to the kingdom of Spain. He had not merely made himself the master of savage tribes; he had conquered the supernatural$ and overcome for ever those powers of darkness that had been thought to brood over the vast Atlantic. He had sailed away in obscurity$ he had returned in fame; he had departed under a cloud of scepticism and ridicule$ he had come again in power and glory. He had sailed from Palos as a seeker after hidden wealth$ hidden knowledge; he returned as teacher$ discoverer$ benefactor. The whole of Spain rang with his fame$ and the echoes of it spread to Portugal$ France$ England$ Germany$ and Italy; and it reached the ears of his own family$ who had now left the Vico Dritto di Ponticello in Genoa and were living at Savona.
Channel,Channel$ Virginia Township$ MO 63877$ USA,-89.9409213,36.0597923,The marriage being accomplished$ and the girl carried away by her bridegroom to his seat in the West$ it was thought safe to release Machin. Whereupon he collected several friends$ and they followed the newly-married couple to Bristol and laid their plans for an abduction. One of the friends got himself engaged as a groom in the service of the unhappy bride$ and found her love unchanged$ and if possible increased by the present misery she was in. An escape was planned; and one day$ when the girl and her groom were riding in the park$ they set spurs to their horses$ and galloped off to a place on the shores of the Bristol Channel where young Robert had a boat on the beach and a ship in the offing. They set sail immediately$ intending to make for France$ where the reunited lovers hoped to live happily; but it came on to blow when they were off the Lizard$ and a southerly gale$ which lasted for thirteen days$ drove them far out of their course.
Santa,Santa$ Peru,-78.58886960000001,-9.0721136,Although the journey from Jamaica to Espanola had been accomplished in four days by Mendez in his canoe$ the caravels conveying the party rescued from Puerto Santa Gloria were seven weary weeks on this short voyage; a strong north-west wind combining with the west-going current to make their progress to the north-west impossible for weeks at a time. It was not until the 13th of August 1503 that they anchored in the harbour of San Domingo$ and Columbus once more set foot$ after an absence of more than two years$ on the territory from the governorship of which he had been deposed.
Guadaloupe,Guadeloupe,-61.55099999999999,16.265,The Admiral sailed on March 10th$ 1496$ carrying with him in chains the vanquished Caonabo and other natives. He touched at Marigalante and at Guadaloupe$ where his people had an engagement with the natives$ taking several prisoners$ but releasing them all again with the exception of one woman$ a handsome creature who had fallen in love with Caonabo and refused to go. But for Caonabo the joys of life and love were at an end; his heart and spirit were broken. He was not destined to be paraded as a captive through the streets of Spain$ and it was somewhere in the deep Atlantic that he paid the last tribute to the power that had captured and broken him. He died on the voyage$ which was longer and much more full of hardships than usual. For some reason or other Columbus did not take the northerly route going home$ but sailed east from Gaudaloupe$ encountering the easterly trade winds$ which delayed him so much that the voyage occupied three months instead of six weeks.

My illness permits me to write only at night$ because in the daytime my hands are deprived of strength. I believe that a son of Francisco Pinelo will carry this letter. Entertain him well$ because he does everything for me that he can$ with much love and a cheerful goodwill. The caravel which broke her mast in starting from Santo Domingo has arrived in the Algarves. She brings the records of the case of the Porras brothers. Such ugly things and such grievous cruelty as appear in this matter never were seen. If their Highnesses do not punish it$ I do not know who will dare to go out in their service with people.

Camacho was still hiding in a church$ probably from the wrath of Bartholomew Columbus; but Christopher has more subtle ways of punishment. A legal document$ he considers$ will be better than a rod; it will not be so much against the conscience of the chastiser$ and will injure him (the chastised) more.
Bank,Raytown $ United States,-94.4640496,39.0088725,Watlings Island$ as it is now called$ or San Salvador$ as Columbus named it$ or Guanahani$ as it was known to the aborigines$ is situated in latitude 24 deg. 6 N.$ and longitude 74 deg 26 W.$ and is an irregularly shaped white sandstone islet in about the middle of the great Bahama Bank. The space occupied by the whole group is shaped like an irregular triangle extending from the Navidad Bank in the Caribbean Sea at the south-east corner$ to Bahama Island in Florida Strait on the north$ about 200 miles. The south side trends west by north for 600 miles$ and the north side north-west by north 720 miles. Most of the islands and small rocks in this group$ called Keys or Cays$ are very low$ and rise only a few feet above the sea; the highest is about 400 feet high. They are generally situated on the edge of coral and sand banks$ some of which are of a very dangerous character. They are thinly wooded$ except in the case of one or two of the larger islands which contain timber of moderate dimensions. The climate of the Bahamas is mild and temperate$ with refreshing sea breezes in the hottest months; and there is a mean temperature of 75 deg. from November to April. Watlings Island is about twelve miles in length by six in breadth$ with rocky shores slightly indented. The greater part of its area is occupied by salt-water lagoons$ separated from one another by small wooded hills from too to 140 feet high. There is plenty of grass; indeed the island is now considered to be the most fertile in the Bahamas$ and raises an excellent breed of cattle and sheep. In common with the other islands of the group it was originally settled by the Spaniards$ and afterwards by the British$ who were driven from the Bahamas again by the Spanish in the year 1641. After a great deal of changing hands they were ceded to Great Britain in 1783$ and have remained in her possession ever since. In 1897 the population of the whole group was estimated at 52$000 the whites being in the proportion of one to six of the coloured population. Watlings Island contains about 600 inhabitants scattered over the surface$ with a small settlement called Cockburn Town on the west side$ nearly opposite the landfall of Columbus. The seat of the local government is in the island of New Providence$ and the inhabitants of Watlings Island and of Rum Cay unite in sending one representative to the House of Assembly. It is high water$ full and change$ at Watlings Island at 7 h. 40 m.$ as it was in the days of Columbus; and these facts form about the sum of the worlds knowledge of and interest in Watlings Island to-day.
Las,Las Vegas $ United States,-115.1537389,36.0839998, He was in his fifty-sixth year$ already an old man in body and mind; and his death went entirely unmarked except by his immediate circle of friends. Even Peter Martyr$ who was in Valladolid just before and just after it$ and who was writing a series of letters to various correspondents giving all the news of his day$ never thought it worth while to mention that Christopher Columbus was dead. His life flickered out in the completest obscurity. It is not even known where he was first buried; but probably it was in the Franciscan convent at Valladolid. This$ however$ was only a temporary resting-place; and a few years later his body was formally interred in the choir of the monastery of Las Cuevas at Seville$ there to lie for thirty years surrounded by continual chauntings. After that it was translated to the cathedral in San Domingo; rested there for 250 years$ and then$ on the cession of that part of the island to France$ the body was removed to Cuba. But the Admiral was by this time nothing but a box of bones and dust$ as also were brother Bartholomew and son Diego$ and Diegos son$ all collected together in that place. There were various examinations of the bone-boxes; one$ supposed to be the Admirals$ was taken to Cuba and solemnly buried there; and lately$ after the conquest of the island in the Spanish-American War$ this box of bones was elaborately conveyed to Seville$ where it now rests.
Costa,Jacksonville $ United States,-81.5012299,30.3618942,The natives at this anchorage of Cariari were rather suspicious$ but Columbus seized two of them to act as guides in his journey further down the coast. Weighing anchor on October 5th he worked along the Costa Rica shore$ which here turns to the eastward again$ and soon found a tribe of natives who wore large ornaments of gold. They were reluctant to part with the gold$ but as usual pointed down the coast and said that there was much more gold there; they even gave a name to the place where the gold could be foundVeragua; and for once this country was found to have a real existence. The fleet anchored there on October 17th$ being greeted by defiant blasts of conch shells and splashing of water from the indignant natives. Business was done$ however: seventeen gold discs in exchange for three hawks bells.
Great,Carroll $ United States,-71.4394811,44.2572787,I have already said that I went 107 leagues along the coast of Juana$ from east to west. Thus$ according to my track$ it is larger than England and Scotland together$ for$ besides these 107 leagues$ there were further west two provinces to which I did not go$ one of which is called Cibau$ the people of which are born with tails; which provinces must be about fifty or sixty leagues long$ according to what I can make out from the Indians I have with me$ who know all the islands. The other island (Espanola) is larger in circuit than the whole of Spain$ from the Straits of Gibralter (the Columns) to Fuentarabia in Biscay$ as I sailed 138 long leagues in a direct line from west to east. Once known it must be desired$ and once seen one desires never to leave it; and which$ being taken possession of for their Highnesses$ and the people being at present in a condition lower than I can possibly describe$ the Sovereigns of Castile may dispose of it in any manner they please in the most convenient places. In this Espanola$ and in the best district$ where are gold mines$ and$ on the other side$ from thence to terra firma$ as well as from thence to the Great Khan$ where everything is on a splendid scaleI have taken possession of a large town$ to which I gave the name of La Navidad$ and have built a fort in it$ in every respect complete. And I have left sufficient people in it to take care of it$ with artillery and provisions for more than a year; also a boat and coxswain with the equipments$ in complete friendship with the King of the islands$ to that degree that he delighted to call me and look on me as his brother. And should they fall out with these people$ neither he nor his subjects know anything of weapons$ and go naked$ as I have said$ and they are the most timorous people in the world. The few people left there are sufficient to conquer the country$ and the island would thus remain without danger to them$ they keeping order among themselves.
Thule,Qaanaaq $ Greenland,-69.2284827,77.4670434,The reasons for doubting that this voyage took place are due simply to Columbuss habit of being untruthful in regard to his own past doings$ and his propensity for drawing the long bow; and the reason that has been accepted by most of his biographers who have denied the truth of this statement is that$ in the year 1492$ when Columbus was addressing the King and Queen of Spain on his qualifications as a navigator$ and when he wished to set forth his experience in a formidable light$ he said nothing about this voyage$ but merely described his explorations as having extended from Guinea on the south to England on the north. A shrewd estimate of Columbuss character makes it indeed seem incredible that$ if he had really been in Iceland$ he should not have mentioned the fact on this occasion; and yet there is just one reason$ also quite characteristic of Columbus$ that would account for the suppression. It is just possible that when he was at Thule$ by which he meant Iceland$ he may have heard of the explorations in the direction of Greenland and Newfoundland; and that$ although by other navigators these lands were regarded as a part of the continent of Europe$ he may have had some glimmerings of an idea that they were part of land and islands in the West; and he was much too jealous of his own reputation as the great and only originator of the project for voyaging to the West$ to give away any hints that he was not the only person to whom such ideas had occurred. There is deception and untruth somewhere; and one must make ones choice between regarding the story in the first place as a lie$ or accepting it as truth$ and putting down Columbuss silence about it on a later occasion to a rare instinct of judicious suppression. There are other facts in his life$ to which$ we shall come later$ that are in accordance with this theory. There is no doubt$ moreover$ that Columbus had a very great experience of the sea$ and was one of the greatest practical seamen$ if not the greatest$ that has ever lived; and it would be foolish to deny$ except for the greatest reasons$ that he made a voyage to the far North$ which was neither unusual at the time nor a very great achievement for a seaman of his experience.
CUBA,Cuba,-77.781167,21.521757,CHAPTER I. THE VOYAGE TO CUBA
Anjou,Montreal $ Canada,-73.5693509,45.6159585,In this faith$ then$ and with this equipment$ and about the year 1465$ Christopher Columbus began his sea travels. His voyages would be doubtless at first much along the coasts$ and across to Alexandria and the Islands. There would be returnings to Genoa$ and glad welcomings by the little household in the narrow street; in 1472 and 1473 he was with his father at Savona$ helping with the wool-weaving and tavern-keeping; possibly also there were interviews with Benincasa$ who was at that time living in Genoa$ and making his famous sea-charts. Perhaps it was in his studio that Christopher first saw a chart$ and first fell in love with the magic that can transfer the shapes of oceans and continents to a piece of paper. Then he would be off again in another ship$ to the Golden Horn perhaps$ or the Black Sea$ for the Genoese had a great Crimean trade. This is all conjecture$ but very reasonable conjecture; what we know for a fact is that he saw the white gum drawn from the lentiscus shrubs in Chio at the time of their flowering; that fragrant memory is preserved long afterwards in his own writings$ evoked by some incident in the newly-discovered islands of the West. There are vague rumours and stories of his having been engaged in various expeditionsamong them one fitted out in Genoa by John of Anjou to recover the kingdom of Naples for King Rene of Provence; but there is no reason to believe these rumours: good reason to disbelieve them$ rather.
Country,Nevada $ United States,-94.3660999,37.8214907,Allard and William$ shuffling into the recruiting office in Palos$ doubtless think that this is a strange place for them to meet$ and rather a wild business that they are embarked upon$ among all these bloody Spaniards. Some how I feel more confidence in Allard than in William$ knowing$ as I do so well$ this William of Galway$ whether on his native heath or in the strange and distant parts of the world to which his sanguine temperament leads him. Alas$ William$ you are but the first of a mighty stream that will leave the Old Country for the New World; the world destined to be good for the fortunes of many from the Old Country$ but for the Old Country itself not good. Little does he know$ drunken William$ willing to be on hand where there is adventure brewing$ and to be after going with the boys and getting his health on the salt water$ what a path of hope for those who go$ and of heaviness for those who stay behind$ he is opening up . . . . Farewell$ William; I hope you were not one of those whom they let out of gaol.
Alcalde,Alcalde $ United States,-106.053634,36.0889116,Some letters of their Highnesses signed in blank$ of which he brought a number$ he filled up and sent to the Alcalde and to his company with favours and commendations: to me he never sent either letter or messenger$ nor has he done so to this day. Imagine what any one holding my office would think when one who endeavoured to rob their Highnesses$ and who has done so much evil and mischief$ is honoured and favoured$ while he who maintained it at such risks is degraded.
Behechio,Bohechío $ Dominican Republic,-70.9888579,18.7743829,The see-saw motion of all affairs with which Columbus had to do was in full swing. We have seen him patching up matters in Espanola; hurrying to Spain just in time to rescue his damaged reputation and do something to restore it; and now when he had come back it was but a sorry tale that Bartholomew had to tell him. A fortress had been built at the Hayna gold-mines$ but provisions had been so scarce that there had been something like a famine among the workmen there; no digging had been done$ no planting$ no making of the place fit for human occupation and industry. Bartholomew had been kept busy in collecting the native tribute$ and in planning out the beginnings of the settlement at the mouth of the river Ozema$ which was at first called the New Isabella$ but was afterwards named San Domingo in honour of old Domenico at Savona. The cacique Behechio had been giving trouble; had indeed marched out with an army against Bartholomew$ but had been more or less reconciled by the intervention of his sister Anacaona$ widow of the late Caonabo$ who had apparently transferred her affections to Governor Bartholomew. The battle was turned into a friendly pagan festivalone of the last ever held on that once happy islandin which native girls danced in a green grove$ with the beautiful Anacaona$ dressed only in garlands$ carried on a litter in their midst.
Vega,La Vega Province$ Dominican Republic,-70.5288753,19.2211554,When the Commander Bobadilla came to Santo Domingo$ I was at La Vega$ and the Adelantado at Xaragua$ where that Adrian had made a stand$ but then all was quiet$ and the land rich and all men at peace. On the second day after his arrival$ he created himself Governor$ and appointed officers and made executions$ and proclaimed immunities of gold and tenths and in general of everything else for twenty years$ which is a mans lifetime$ and that he came to pay everybody in full up to that day$ even though they had not rendered service; and he publicly gave notice that$ as for me$ he had charge to send me in irons$ and my brothers likewise$ as he has done$ and that I should nevermore return thither$ nor any other of my family: alleging a thousand disgraceful and discourteous things about me. All this took place on the second day after his arrival$ as I have said$ and while I was absent at a distance$ without my knowing either of him or of his arrival.
Gardens,Merritt Island $ United States,-80.705192,28.37486,Their six days sojourn amid the Queens Gardens$ then$ was not a great success; and as soon as they were able they set sail again$ standing eastward when the wind permitted them. But wind and current were against them and all through the month of May and the early part of June they struggled along the south coast of Cuba$ their ships as full of holes as a honeycomb$ pumps going incessantly$ and in addition the worn-out seamen doing heroic labour at baling with buckets and kettles. Lee helm! Down go the buckets and kettles and out run the wretched scarecrows of seamen to the weary business of tacking ship$ letting go$ brailing up$ hauling in$ and making fast for the thousandth time; and then back to the pumps and kettles again. No human being could endure this for an indefinite time; and though their diet of worms represented by the rotten biscuit was varied with cassava bread supplied by friendly natives$ the Admiral could not make his way eastward further than Cape Cruz. Round that cape his leaking$ strained vessels could not be made to look against the wind and the tide. Could hardly indeed be made to float or swim upon the water at all; and the Admiral had now to consider$ not whether he could sail on a particular point of the compass$ but whether he could by any means avoid another course which the fates now proposed to himnamely$ a perpendicular course to the bottom of the sea. It was a race between the water and the ships$ and the only thing the Admiral could think of was to turn southward across to Jamaica$ which he did on June 23rd$ putting into Puerto Bueno$ now called Dry Harbour. But there was no food there$ and as his ships were settling deeper and deeper in the water he had to make sail again and drive eastwards as far as Puerto Santa Gloria$ now called Don Christophers Cove. He was just in time. The ships were run ashore side by side on a sandy beach$ the pumps were abandoned$ and in one tide the ships were full of water. The remaining anchor cables were used to lash the two ships together so that they would not move; although there was little fear of that$ seeing the weight of water that was in them. Everything that could be saved was brought up on deck$ and a kind of cabin or platform which could be fortified was rigged on the highest part of the ships. And so no doubt for some days$ although their food was almost finished$ the wretched and exhausted voyagers could stretch their cramped limbs$ and rest in the warm sun$ and listen$ from their safe haven on the firm sands$ to the hated voice of the sea.
South,Sacramento $ United States,-121.4967763,38.5686072,Another great conquest of the salt unknown taken place a few days before Columbus sailed on his third voyage. The accidental discovery of the Cape by Bartholomew Diaz in 1486 had not been neglected by Portugal; and the achievements of Columbus$ while they cut off Portuguese enterprise from the western ocean$ had only stimulated it to greater activity within its own spheres. Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon in July 1497; by the end of November he had rounded the Cape of Good Hope; and in May 1498$ after a long voyage full of interest$ peril$ and hardship he had landed at Calicut on the shores of the true India. He came back in 1499 with a battered remnant$ his crew disabled by sickness and exhaustion$ and half his ships lost; but he had in fact discovered a road for trade and adventure to the East that was not paved with promises$ dreams$ or mad affidavits$ but was a real and tangible achievement$ bringing its reward in commerce and wealth for Portugal. At that very moment Columbus was groping round the mainland of South America$ thinking it to be the coast of Cathay$ and the Garden of Eden$ and God knows what other cosmographicaltheological abstractions; and Portugal$ busy with her arrangements for making money$ could afford for the moment to look on undismayed at the development of the mine of promises discovered by the Spanish Admiral.
Socotra,Socotra$ Yemen,53.8237385,12.4634205,We must think of him$ then$ at school in Genoa$ grinding out the tasks that are the common heritage of all small boys; working a little at the weaving$ interestedly enough at first$ no doubt$ while the importance of having a loom appealed to him$ but also no doubt rapidly cooling off in his enthusiasm as the pastime became a task$ and the restriction of indoor life began to be felt. For if ever there was a little boy who loved to idle about the wharves and docks$ here was that little boy. It was here$ while he wandered about the crowded quays and listened to the medley of talk among the foreign sailors$ and looked beyond the masts of the ships into the blue distance of the sea$ that the desire to wander and go abroad upon the face of the waters must first have stirred in his heart. The wharves of Genoa in those days combined in themselves all the richness of romance and adventure$ buccaneering$ trading$ and treasure-snatching$ that has ever crowded the pages of romance. There were galleys and caravels$ barques and feluccas$ pinnaces and caraccas. There were slaves in the galleys$ and bowmen to keep the slaves in subjection. There were dark-bearded Spaniards$ fair-haired Englishmen; there were Greeks$ and Indians$ and Portuguese. The bales of goods on the harbour-side were eloquent of distant lands$ and furnished object lessons in the only geography that young Christopher was likely to be learning. There was cotton from Egypt$ and tin and lead from Southampton. There were butts of Malmsey from Candia; aloes and cassia and spices from Socotra; rhubarb from Persia; silk from India; wool from Damascus$ raw wool also from Calais and Norwich. No wonder if the little house in the Vico Dritto di Ponticello became too narrow for the boy; and no wonder that at the age of fourteen he was able to have his way$ and go to sea. One can imagine him gradually acquiring an influence over his father$ Domenico$ as his will grew stronger and firmerhe with one grand object in life$ Domenico with none; he with a single clear purpose$ and Domenico with innumerable cloudy ones. And so$ on some day in the distant past$ there were farewells and anxious hearts in the weavers house$ and Christopher$ member of the crew of some trading caravel or felucca$ a diminishing object to the wet eyes of his mother$ sailed away$ and faded into the blue distance.
Christoval,Christoval $ United States,-100.4987052,31.1935006,They did a little quiet discovery$ principally in the domain of human nature$ caroused with the friendly natives$ but attended to business all the time; with the result that in the following April they were back in Spain with a treasure of pearls out of which$ after Nifio had been made independent for life and Guerra$ Christoval$ and the rest of them had their shares$ there remained a handsome sum for the Crown. An extremely practical$ businesslike voyage this; full of lessons for our poor Christopher$ could he but have known and learned them.
Honduras,Honduras,-86.241905,15.199999,The coast of the mainland had thus been explored from the Bay of Honduras to Brazil$ and Columbus was obliged to admit that there was no strait. Having satisfied himself of that he decided to turn back to Veragua$ where he had seen the natives smelting gold$ in order to make some arrangement for establishing a colony there. The wind$ however$ which had headed him almost all the way on his easterly voyage$ headed him again now and began to blow steadily from the west. He started on his return journey on the 5th of December$ and immediately fell into almost worse troubles than he had been in before. The wood of the ships had been bored through and through by seaworms$ so that they leaked very badly; the crews were sick$ provisions were spoilt$ biscuits rotten. Young Ferdinand Columbus$ if he did not actually make notes of this voyage at the time$ preserved a very lively recollection of it$ and it is to his Historie$ which in its earlier passages is of doubtful authenticity$ that we owe some of the most human touches of description relating to this voyage. Any passage in his work relating to food or animals at this time has the true ring of boyish interest and observation$ and is in sharp contrast to the second-hand and artificial tone of the earlier chapters of his book. About the incident of the howling monkey$ which the Admirals Irish hound would not face$ Ferdinand remarks that it frighted a good dog that we had$ but frighted one of our wild boars a great deal more; and as to the condition of the biscuits when they turned westward again$ he says that they were so full of weevils that$ as God shall help me$ I saw many that stayed till night to eat their sop for fear of seeing them.
Augustine,Atlanta $ United States,-84.3767958,33.7465898,VERY DEAR SON$I received your letter by the courier. You did well in remaining yonder to remedy our affairs somewhat and to employ yourself now in our business. Ever since I came to Castile$ the Lord Bishop of Palencia has shown me favour and has desired that I should be honoured. Now he must be entreated that it may please him to occupy himself in remedying my many grievances and in ordering that the agreement and letters of concession which their Highnesses gave me be fulfilled$ and that I be indemnified for so many damages. And he may be certain that if their Highnesses do this$ their estate and greatness will be multiplied to them in an incredible degree. And it must not appear to him that forty thousand pesos in gold is more than a representation of it; because they might have had a much greater quantity if Satan had not hindered it by impeding my design; for$ when I was taken away from the Indies$ I was prepared to give them a sum of gold incomparable to forty thousand pesos. I make oath$ and this may be for thee alone$ that the damage to me in the matter of the concessions their Highnesses have made to me$ amounts to ten millions each year$ and never can be made good. You see what will be$ or is$ the injury to their Highnesses in what belongs to them$ and they do not perceive it. I write at their disposal and will strive to start yonder. My arrival and the rest is in the hands of our Lord. His mercy is infinite. What is done and is to be done$ St. Augustine says is already done before the creation of the world. I write also to these other Lords named in the letter of Diego Mendez. Commend me to their mercy and tell them of my going as I have said above. For certainly I feel great fear$ as the cold is so inimical to this$ my infirmity$ that I may have to remain on the road.
Egypt,Egypt,30.802498,26.820553,I mounted to the top of the ship crying out with a weak voice$ weeping bitterly$ to the commanders of your Majesties army$ and calling again to the four winds to help; but they did not answer me. Tired out$ I fell asleep and sighing I heard a voice very full of pity which spoke these words: O fool! and slow to believe and to serve Him$ thy God and the God of all. What did He more for Moses? and for David His servant? Since thou wast born He had always so great care for thee. When He saw thee in an age with which He was content He made thy name sound marvellously through the world. The Indies$ which are so rich apart of the world$ He has given to thee as thine. Thou hast distributed them wherever it has pleased thee; He gave thee power so to do. Of the bonds of the ocean which were locked with so strong chains He gave thee the keys$ and thou wast obeyed in all the land$ and among the Christians thou hast acquired a good and honourable reputation. What did He more for the people of Israel when He brought them out of Egypt? or yet for David$ whom from being a shepherd He made King of Judea? Turn to Him and recognise thine error$ for His mercy is infinite. Thine old age will be no hindrance to all great things. Many very great inheritances are in His power. Abraham was more than one hundred years old when he begat Isaac and also Sarah was not young. Thou art calling for uncertain aid. Answer me$ who has afflicted thee so much and so many timesGod or the world? The privileges and promises which God makes He never breaks to any one; nor does He say after having received the service that His intention was not so and it is to be understood in another manner: nor imposes martyrdom to give proof of His power. He abides by the letter of His word. All that He promises He abundantly accomplishes. This is His way. I have told thee what the Creator hath done for thee and does for all. Now He shows me the reward and payment of thy suffering and which thou hast passed in the service of others. And thus half dead$ I heard everything; but I could never find an answer to make to words so certain$ and only I wept for my errors. He$ who ever he might be$ finished speaking$ saying: Trust and fear not$ for thy tribulations are written in marble and not without reason.
Inquisitor,Shreveport $ United States,-93.9009179,32.6433804,The commission given to Aguado was very brief$ and so vaguely worded that it might mean much or little$ according to the discretion of the commissioner and the necessities of the case as viewed by him. We send to you Juan Aguada$ our Groom of the Chambers$ who will speak to you on our part. We command you to give him faith and credit. A letter was also sent to Columbus in which he was instructed to reduce the number of people dependent on the colony to five hundred instead of a thousand; and the control of the mines was entrusted to one Pablo Belvis$ who was sent out as chief metallurgist. As for the slaves that Columbus had sent home$ Isabella forbade their sale until inquiry could be made into the condition of their capture$ and the fine moral point involved was entrusted to the ecclesiastical authorities for examination and solution. Poor Christopher$ knowing as he did that five hundred heretics were being burned every year by the Grand Inquisitor$ had not expected this hair-splitting over the fate of heathens who had rebelled against Spanish authority; and it caused him some distress when he heard of it. The theologians$ however$ proved equal to the occasion$ and the slaves were duly sold in Seville market.
Loxa,Indianapolis $ United States,-86.070292,39.916226,It was not the happiest moment$ indeed$ in which to talk of ships and charts$ and lonely sea-roads$ and faraway undiscovered shores. Things at home were very real and lively in those spring days at Cordova. The war against the Moors had reached a critical stage; King Ferdinand was away laying siege to the city of Loxa$ and though the Queen was at Cordova she was entirely occupied with the business of collecting and forwarding troops and supplies to his aid. The streets were full of soldiers; nobles and grandees from all over the country were arriving daily with their retinues; glitter and splendour$ and the pomp of warlike preparation$ filled the city. Early in June the Queen herself went to the front and joined her husband in the siege of Moclin; and when this was victoriously ended$ and they had returned in triumph to Cordova$ they had to set out again for Gallicia to suppress a rebellion there. When that was over they did not come back to Cordova at all$ but repaired at once to Salamanca to spend the winter there.
Orient,Orient $ United States,-72.303415,41.1389875,In his Journal for this day$ and amid all his anxieties$ he found time to note down one of his curious visionary cosmographical reflections. This return to a region of storms and heavy seas reminded him of the long months he had spent in the balmy weather and calm waters of his discovery; in which facts he found a confirmation of the theological idea that the Eden$ or Paradise$ of earth was at the end of the Orient$ because it is a most temperate place. So that these lands which he had now discovered are at the end of the Orient. Reflections such as these$ which abound in his writings$ ought in themselves to be a sufficient condemnation of those who have endeavoured to prove that Columbus was a man of profound cosmographical learning and of a scientific mind. A man who would believe that he had discovered the Orient because in the place where he had been he had found calm weather$ and because the theologians said that the Garden of Eden must be in the Orient since it is a temperate place$ would believe anything.
Estremadura,Extremadura$ Spain,-6.0679194,39.4937392,As they approached it Columbus christened it Dominica in honour of the day on which it was discovered. He sailed round it; but as there was no harbour$ and as another island was in sight to the north$ he sailed on in that direction. This little island he christened Marigalante; and going ashore with his retinue he hoisted the royal banner$ and formally took possession of the whole group of six islands which were visible from the high ground. There were no inhabitants on the island$ but the voyagers spent some hours wandering about its tangled woods and smelling the rich odours of spice$ and tasting new and unfamiliar fruits. They next sailed on to an island to the north which Columbus christened Guadaloupe as a memorial of the shrine in Estremadura to which he had made a pious pilgrimage. They landed on this island and remained a week there$ in the course of which they made some very remarkable discoveries.
Saltes,Isla Saltes$ 21001$ Huelva$ Spain,-6.956388899999999,37.1927778,The caravel had been sighted some time before$ probably when she was standing off$ the bar waiting for the tide; she was flying the Admirals flag and there was no mistaking her identity; and we can imagine the news spreading throughout the town of Palos$ and reaching Huelva$ and one by one the bells beginning to ring$ and the places of business to be closed$ and the people to come pouring out into the streets to be ready to greet their friends. Some more impatient than the others would sail out in fishing-boats to get the first news; and I should be surprised to know that a boat did not put off from the little pier beneath La Rabida$ to row round the point and out to where the Nina was lyingto beyond the Manto Bank. When the flood began to make over the bar and to cover the long sandbank that stretches from the island of Saltes$ the Nina came gliding in$ greeted by every joyful sound and signal that the inhabitants of the two seaports could make. Every one hurried down to Palos as the caravel rounded the Convent Point. Hernando$ Marchena$ and good old Juan Perez were all there$ we may be sure. Such excitements$ such triumphs as the bronzed$ white-bearded Admiral steps ashore at last$ and is seized by dozens of eager hands! Such excitements as all the wives and inamoratas of the Rodrigos and Juans and Franciscos rush to meet the swarthy voyagers and cover them with embraces; such disappointments also$ when it is realised that some two score of the company are still on a sunbaked island infinitely far over the western horizon.
Madeira,Madeira$ Portugal,-16.9594723,32.76070740000001,Columbus was at sea again; firm ground to him$ although so treacherous and unstable to most of us; and as he saw the Spanish coast sinking down on the horizon he could shake himself free from his troubles$ and feel that once more he was in a situation of which he was master. He first touched at Porto Santo$ where$ if the story of his residence there be true$ there must have been potent memories for him in the sight of the long white beach and the plantations$ with the Governors house beyond. He stayed there only a few hours and then crossed over to Madeira$ anchoring in the Bay of Funchal$ where he took in wood and water. As it was really unnecessary for him to make a port so soon after leaving$ there was probably some other reason for his visit to these islands; perhaps a family reason; perhaps nothing more historically important than the desire to look once more on scenes of bygone happiness$ for even on the page of history every event is not necessarily big with significance. From Madeira he took a southerly course to the Canary Islands$ and on June 16th anchored at Gomera$ where he found a French warship with two Spanish prizes$ all of which put to sea as the Admirals fleet approached. On June 21st$ when he sailed from Gomera$ he divided his fleet of six vessels into two squadrons. Three ships were despatched direct to Espanola$ for the supplies which they carried were urgently needed there. These three ships were commanded by trustworthy men: Pedro de Arana$ a brother of Beatriz$ Alonso Sanchez de Carvajal$ and Juan Antonio Colombothis last no other than a cousin of Christophers from Genoa. The sons of Domenicos provident younger brother had not prospered$ while the sons of improvident Domenico were now all in high places; and these three poor cousins$ hearing of Christophers greatness$ and deciding that use should be made of him$ scraped together enough money to send one of their number to Spain. The Admiral always had a sound family feeling$ and finding that cousin Antonio had sea experience and knew how to handle a ship he gave him command of one of the caravels on this voyagea command of which he proved capable and worthy. From these three captains$ after giving them full sailing directions for reaching Espanola$ Columbus parted company off the island of Ferro. He himself stood on a southerly course towards the Cape Verde Islands.
Lisbon,Lisbon $ Portugal,-9.1393366,38.7222524,VERY DEAR SON$I wrote you at length by the courier who will arrive there to-day$ and sent you a letter for the Lord Chamberlain. I intended to inclose in it a copy of that chapter of the letter from their Highnesses in which they say they will order you placed in possession; but I forgot to do it here. Zamora$ the courier$ came. I read your letter and also those of your uncle and brother and Carbajal$ and felt great pleasure in learning that they had arrived well$ as I had been very anxious about them. Diego Mendez will leave here in three or four days with the order of payment prepared. He will take a long statement of everything and I will write to Juan Velasquez. I desire his friendship and service. I believe that he is a very honourable gentleman. If the Lord Bishop of Palencia has come$ or comes$ tell him how much pleased I have been with his prosperity$ and that if I go there I must stop with his Worship even if he does not wish it$ and that we must return to our first fraternal love. And that he could not refuse it because my service will force him to have it thus. I said that the letter for the Holy Father was sent that his Worship might see it if he was there$ and also the Lord Archbishop of Seville$ as the King might not have opportunity to read it. I have already told you that the petition to their Highnesses must be for the fulfilment of what they wrote me about the possession and of the rest which was promised me. I said that this chapter of the letter must be shown them and said that it must not be delayed$ and that this is advisable for an infinite number of reasons. His Highness may believe that$ however much he gives me$ the increase of his exalted dominions and revenue will be in the proportion of 100 to 1$ and that there is no comparison between what has been done and what is to be done. The sending of a Bishop to Espanola must be delayed until I speak to his Highness. It must not be as in the other cases when it was thought to mend matters and they were spoiled. There have been some cold days here and they have caused me great fatigue and fatigue me now. Commend me to the favour of the Lord Adelantado. May our Lord guard and bless you and your brother. Give my regards to Carbajal and Jeronimo. Diego Mendez will carry a full pouch there. I believe that the affair of which you wrote can be very easily managed. The vessels from the Indies have not arrived from Lisbon. They brought a great deal of gold$ and none for me. So great a mockery was never seen$ for I left there 60$000 pesos smelted. His Highness should not allow so great an affair to be ruined$ as is now taking place. He now sends to the Governor a new provision. I do not know what it is about. I expect letters each day. Be very careful about expenditures$ for it is necessary.
Earth,Earth $ United States,-102.4107493,34.2331373,After that there was never any more resistance; it was simply a case of extermination$ which the Spaniards easily accomplished by cutting of the heads of women as they passed by$ and impaling infants and little children on their lances as they rode through the villages. Thus$ in the twelve years since the discovery of Columbus$ between half a million and a million natives$ perished; and as the Spanish colonisation spread afterwards from island to island$ and the banner of civilisation and Christianity was borne farther abroad throughout the Indies$ the same hideous process was continued. In Cuba$ in Jamaica$ throughout the Antilles$ the cross and the sword$ the whip-lash and the Gospel advanced together; wherever the Host was consecrated$ hideous cries of agony and suffering broke forth; until happily$ in the fulness of time$ the dire business was complete$ and the whole of the people who had inhabited this garden of the world were exterminated and their blood and race wiped from the face of the earth . . . . Unless$ indeed$ blood and race and hatred be imperishable things; unless the faithful Earth that bred and reared the race still keeps in her soil$ and in the waving branches of the trees and the green grasses$ the sacred essences of its blood and hatred; unless in the full cycle of Time$ when that suffering flesh and blood shall have gone through all the changes of substance and condition$ from corruption and dust through flowers and grasses and trees and animals back into the living body of mankind again$ it shall one day rise up terribly to avenge that horror of the past. Unless Earth and Time remember$ O Children of the Sun! for men have forgotten$ and on the soil of your Paradise the African negro$ learned in the vices of Europe$ erects his monstrous effigy of civilisation and his grotesque mockery of freedom; unless it be through his brutish body$ into which the blood and hatred with which the soil of Espanola was soaked have now passed$ that they shall dreadfully strike at the world again.
Hayti,Hayti $ United States,-89.74952720000002,36.233679,It was on the 20th of August that Columbus$ having the day before seen the last of the dim blue hills of Jamaica$ sighted again the long peninsula of Hayti$ called by him Cape San Miguel$ but known to us as Cape Tiburon; although it was not until he was hailed by a cacique who called out to him Almirante$ Almirante$ that the seaworn mariners realised with joy that the island must be Espanola. But they were a long way from Isabella yet. They sailed along the south coast$ meeting contrary winds$ and at one point landing nine men who were to cross the island$ and try to reach Isabella by land. Week followed week$ and they made very poor progress. In the beginning of September they were caught in a severe tempest$ which separated the ships for a time$ and held the Admiral weather-bound for eight days. There was an eclipse of the moon during this period$ and he took advantage of it to make an observation for longitude$ by which he found himself to be 5 hrs. 23 min.$ or 80 deg. 40$ west of Cadiz. In this observation there is an error of eighteen degrees$ the true longitude of the island of Saona$ where the observation was taken$ being 62 deg. 20 west of Cadiz; and the error is accounted for partly by the inaccuracy of the tables of Regiomontanus and partly by the crudity and inexactness of the Admirals methods. On the 24th of September they at last reached the easternmost point of Espanola$ named by Columbus San Rafael. They stood to the east a little longer$ and discovered the little island of Mona$ which lies between Espanola and Puerto Rico; and from thence shaped their course west-by-north for Isabella. And no sooner had the course been set for home than the Admiral suddenly and completely collapsed; was carried unconscious to his cabin; and lay there in such extremity that his companions gave him up for lost.
